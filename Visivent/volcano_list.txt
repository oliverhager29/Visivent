"West Eifel Volcanic Field","6.850,50.170","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015001.jpg","","The West Eifel volcanic field in the Rhineland district of western Germany SW of the city of Bonn is a dominantly Pleistocene group of 240 scoria cones, maars, and small stratovolcanoes covering an area of about 600 sq km. It lies about 40 km SW of the smaller, but better known, East Eifel volcanic field. Individual vents, most of which cover a broad NW-SE-trending area extending about 50 km from the towns of Ormont on the NW to Bad Bertrich on the SE, were erupted above a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Scoria cones, about half of which have produced lava flows, form two-thirds of the volcanic centers, and about 30% are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years. The latest eruptions formed the Ulmener, Pulvermaar, and Strohn maars around the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene."
"Chaine des Puys","2.970,45.775","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/088002.jpg","http://wwwobs.univ-bpclermont.fr/opgc/webcam.php","The Chaîne des Puys, prominent in the history of volcanology, form a N-S-trending chain of basaltic and trachytic cinder cones, basaltic maars, and trachytic lava domes in France's Massif Central that has been active into the Holocene. Construction of the present-day Chaîne des Puys began about 70,000 years before present (BP), and was largely completed by the beginning of the Holocene. Holocene eruptions constructed lava domes such as the Puy de Dôme, whose growth was accompanied by pyroclastic flows, cinder cones that fed lengthy lava flows, and maars. The latest well-documented activity took place about 6000 years BP near Besse-en-Chandesse and included the powerful explosions that formed the Lac Pavin maar. The dating of younger tephras has not yet been confirmed, and reports of historical eruptions as late as 1000 years BP have been discredited."
"Olot Volcanic Field","2.530,42.170","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119091.jpg","","The Olot volcanic field (also known as the Garrotxa volcanic field) occupies the NE corner of Spain south of the Pyrenees Mountains about 90 km NNE of Barcelona. The Olot volcanic field consists of a large number of strombolian pyroclastic cones and associated alkali basaltic lava flows and is part of the NE Volcanic Province, which includes the Ampurdán and Selva areas to the SE. The pyroclastic cones are preferentially located at the intersection of E-W and NW-SE faults that cut sedimentary and metamorphic basement rocks. The latest dated eruption at Olot occurred during the early Holocene, and stratigraphic evidence suggests that more recent eruptions have occurred."
"Calatrava Volcanic Field","-4.020,38.870","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118054.jpg","","The dominantly Pliocene Calatrava volcanic field lies in central Spain near Ciudad Real. The more than 300 basaltic-to-foiditic pyroclastic cones, maars, and lava domes cover an area of more than 5000 sq km. The Calatrava volcanic field is mostly of Pliocene or late-Pleistocene age, although late-stage phreatomagmatic activity at Columba volcano was dated at the mid-Holocene. The volcanic field lies in a continental rift setting and contains several lake-filled maars. Fumarolic activity was recorded in the Sierra de Valenzuela area during the 16th-18th centuries."
"Larderello","10.870,43.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094048.jpg","","Larderello, one of the world's most productive geothermal areas, is located in the southern part of the Tuscany region of Italy. This extensive solfatara field lies in an area underlain by sediments of Eocene-to-Pliocene age. The geothermal activity is considered to be related to a cooling granitic pluton of Pliocene age beneath sedimentary and metamorphic rocks ranging from Paleozoic to Tertiary age, although the area is cut by faults with hydrothermal mineralization related to Pliocene-to-Quaternary Tuscan magmatism. The only surficial morphological manifestation of volcanism is a series of about a dozen explosion craters 30-250 m in diameter. The Lago Vecchienna crater, now filled by a 250-m-wide lake, ejected blocks and ash during a phreatic eruption in about 1282 CE (Marinelli, 1969)."
"Vulsini","11.930,42.600","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015006.jpg","","The Vulsini volcanic complex in central Italy covers about 2200 sq km at the northern end of the Roman magmatic province. Following lava extrusion and explosive eruptions that constructed the main Vulsini complex, the 16-km-wide, lake-filled Bolsena caldera on the east and the 8 x 11 km Latera caldera on the west were formed during major Pleistocene explosive eruptions at about 0.3 and 0.16 million years ago, respectively. Five major plinian fall deposits were erupted from vents at or near Latera caldera during the late Pleistocene. The latest major eruption formed unwelded pumice flows and welded airfall tuffs of the Pitigliano Formation, associated with collapse of the Vepe caldera about 166,000 years ago at the NW end of Latera caldera. Post-caldera volcanism produced scoria cones and lava flows from vents within and to the west of Latera caldera and lasted until subrecent times. Youthful-looking remnants of ash cones in Lake Bolsena may have given rise to a legend of a pre-historical fire-god, Volta. An historical report noted that 'a flame shot up near Volsini' in 104 BCE."
"Alban Hills","12.700,41.730","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/088019.jpg","","The Alban Hills (Colli Albano) complex immediately SE of Rome contains a large Pleistocene stratovolcano with a 10 x 12 km wide caldera. The caldera was formed during an eruptive period with six major explosive eruptions producing at least 280 cu km of ejecta between about 560,000 and 350,000 years ago. Subsequent eruptions occurred from a new 5-km-wide central cone and from many phreatomagmatic craters and cones within the Artemisio-Tuscolana caldera and on its outer flanks. The post-caldera eruptions have buried the western side of the caldera rim. The largest of the post-caldera craters is Lake Albano, a 4 x 2.5 km wide compound maar constructed at the WSW margin of the caldera in multiple stages dating back to about 69,000 years ago. The age of the most recent eruptions from the Albano maar is not known precisely; variable dates range from about 36,000 years ago to perhaps the Holocene, when several perhaps non-volcanic lake overflow lahars occurred. Reported historical eruptions during the Roman period are uncertain, but seismic swarms of up to two years duration have been recorded since Roman times."
"Campi Flegrei","14.139,40.827","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015011.jpg","","Campi Flegrei is a large 13-km-wide caldera on the outskirts of Naples that contains numerous phreatic tuff rings and pyroclastic cones. The caldera margins are poorly defined, and on the south lie beneath the Gulf of Pozzuoli. Episodes of dramatic uplift and subsidence within the dominantly trachytic caldera have occurred since Roman times. The earliest known eruptive products are dated 47,000 yrs BP. The caldera formed following two large explosive eruptions, the massive Campanian ignimbrite about 36,000 BP, and the >40 cu km Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) about 15,000 BP. Following eruption of the NYT a large number of eruptions have taken place from widely scattered subaerial and submarine vents. Most activity occurred during three intervals: 15,000-9500, 8600-8200, and 4800-3800 BP. Two eruptions have occurred in historical time, one in 1158 at Solfatara and the other in 1538 that formed the Monte Nuovo cinder cone."
"Vesuvius","14.426,40.821","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015031.jpg","http://www.vesuvioinrete.it/e_webcam.htm","One of the world's most noted volcanoes, Vesuvius (Vesuvio) forms a dramatic backdrop to the Bay of Naples. The historically active cone of Vesuvius was constructed within a large caldera of the ancestral Monte Somma volcano, thought to have formed incrementally beginning about 17,000 years ago. The Monte Somma caldera wall has channeled lava flows and pyroclastic flows primarily to the south and west. Eight major explosive eruptions have taken place in the last 17,000 years, often accompanied by large pyroclastic flows and surges, such as during the well-known 79 CE Pompeii eruption. Intermittent eruptions since 79 CE were followed by a period of frequent long-term explosive and effusive eruptions beginning in 1631 and lasting until 1944. The 1631 eruption was the largest since 79 CE and produced devastating pyroclastic flows that reached as far as the coast and caused great destruction. Many towns are located on the volcano's flanks, and several million people live within areas potentially affected by eruptions of Vesuvius."
"Palinuro","14.830,39.480","Palinuro seamount in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of the Eolian Islands rises nearly 3000 m to within 70 m of the sea surface and has a horseshoe-shaped summit caldera. A marine ash layer (PL-1) radiocarbon dated (calibrated age) at 9990 +/- 90 years ago is chemically and stratigraphically similiar to two ash layers of similar composition onland in southern Italy and was tentatively correlated to the Palinuro seamount activity (Siani et al., 2004)."
"Ischia","13.897,40.730","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104074.jpg","","The Ischia volcanic complex forms a rectangular, 6 x 9 km island immediately SW of the Campi Flegrei area at the western side of the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000 years ago was followed by caldera formation. The high point on the island, 789-m-high Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic horst composed of the Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least 800 m of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows, and a major collapse of Mount Epomeo produced a large submarine debris-avalanche deposit. The latest eruption, in 1302 CE, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast."
"Panarea","15.070,38.630","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/103091.jpg","","The mostly submerged Panarea volcanic complex lies about halfway between Stromboli and Lipari in the eastern part of the Aeolian Islands. The 421-m-high island of Panarea, the smallest in the Aeolian Archipelago, lies on the western side of a shallow platform whose shelf margin is at about 130 m depth. A series of small islands breach the surface to form the Central Reefs, the rim of a crater 2 km east of Panarea whose shallow submerged floor contains Roman ruins. The submerged Secca dei Pesci lava dome lies at the SE end of the platform, and the rhyolitic Basiluzzo lava dome rises 165 m above the surface at the NE end, along a ridge trending towards Stromboli volcano. The Panarea complex was constructed in two main stages; initial effusive activity that produced lava domes, and an explosive stage. The youngest subaerial airfall-tephra deposits of the Panarea complex are dated at about 20,000 years ago; a <10,000 BP date on a lava flow is uncertain. Vigorous hydrothermal activity has continued at fumarolic fields at several locations on the submerged platform, and submarine hydrothermal explosions have occurred in historical time."
"Lipari","14.950,38.480","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015035.jpg","","Lipari, the largest of the Aeolian Islands, is located immediately north of Vulcano Island. The irregular-shaped island contains numerous small stratovolcanoes, craters, and lava domes on a basement of submarine volcanic deposits. Lipari was formed in three major eruptive cycles, the first of which took place from about 223 to 188 thousand years ago (ka) from N-S-trending fissures on the western side of the island. The second eruptive period from about 102 to 53 ka included the formation of the Monte San Angelo and Costa d'Agosto stratovolcanoes in the center of the island. The third eruptive cycle (40 ka to the present) included the Monte Guardia sequence, erupted at the southern tip of the island between about 22,600 and 16,800 years ago, and Holocene rhyolitic pyroclastic deposits and obsidian lava flows at the NE end of the island. The latest eruption, at Monte Pilato on the NE tip of the island, formed the Rocche Rosse and Forgia Vecchia obsidian lava flows, which have been dated variously from about 500 to 1230 CE. Objects made of obsidian from Lipari have been found throughout southern Italy."
"Stromboli","15.213,38.789","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091031.jpg","http://www.volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=211050","Spectacular incandescent nighttime explosions at this volcano have long attracted visitors to the 'Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.' Stromboli, the NE-most of the Aeolian Islands, has lent its name to the frequent mild explosive activity that has characterized its eruptions throughout much of historical time. The small, 924-m-high island is the emergent summit of a volcano that grew in two main eruptive cycles, the last of which formed the western portion of the island. The Neostromboli eruptive period from about 13,000 to 5000 years ago was followed by formation of the modern Stromboli edifice. The active summit vents are located at the head of the Sciara del Fuoco, a prominent horseshoe-shaped scarp formed about 5000 years ago as a result of the most recent of a series of slope failures that extend to below sea level. The modern volcano has been constructed within this scarp, which funnels pyroclastic ejecta and lava flows to the NW. Essentially continuous mild strombolian explosions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, have been recorded for more than a millennium."
"Vulcano","14.962,38.404","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015041.jpg","","The word volcano is derived from Vulcano stratovolcano in Italy's Aeolian Islands. Vulcano was constructed during six stages during the past 136,000 years. Two overlapping calderas, the 2.5-km-wide Caldera del Piano on the SE and the 4-km-wide Caldera della Fossa on the NW, were formed at about 100,000 and 24,000-15,000 years ago, respectively, and volcanism has migrated to the north over time. La Fossa cone, active throughout the Holocene and the location of most of the historical eruptions, occupies the 3-km-wide Caldera della Fossa at the NW end of the elongated 3 x 7 km island. The Vulcanello lava platform forms a low, roughly circular peninsula on the northern tip of Vulcano that was formed as an island beginning in 183 BCE and was connected to Vulcano in about 1550 CE. Vulcanello is capped by three pyroclastic cones and was active intermittently until the 16th century. The latest eruption from Vulcano consisted of explosive activity from the Fossa cone from 1898 to 1900."
"Etna","15.004,37.734","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015052.jpg","http://www.ct.ingv.it/en/webcam-etna.html","Mount Etna, towering above Catania, Sicily's second largest city, has one of the world's longest documented records of historical volcanism, dating back to 1500 BCE. Historical lava flows of basaltic composition cover much of the surface of this massive volcano, whose edifice is the highest and most voluminous in Italy. The Mongibello stratovolcano, truncated by several small calderas, was constructed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene over an older shield volcano. The most prominent morphological feature of Etna is the Valle del Bove, a 5 x 10 km horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the east. Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur at Etna. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more of the three prominent summit craters, the Central Crater, NE Crater, and SE Crater (the latter formed in 1978). Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows. Lava flows extend to the foot of the volcano on all sides and have reached the sea over a broad area on the SE flank."
"Pantelleria","12.020,36.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115002.jpg","","The island of Pantelleria is constructed above a drowned continental rift in the Strait of Sicily and has been the locus of intensive volcano-tectonic activity. Two large Pleistocene calderas dominate the island, which contains numerous post-caldera lava domes and cinder cones and is the type locality for peralkaline rhyolitic rocks, pantellerites. The 15-km-long island is the emergent summit of a largely submarine edifice. The 6-km-wide Cinque Denti caldera, the youngest of the two calderas, formed about 45,000 years ago and contains the two post-caldera shield volcanoes of Monte Grande and Monte Gibele. Holocene eruptions have constructed pumice cones, lava domes, and short, blocky lava flows. Many Holocene vents are located on three sides of the uplifted Montagna Grande block on the SE side of the island. A submarine eruption in 1891 from a vent ~4 km off the NW coast is the only confirmed historical activity."

The volcanoes were constructed within a submarine depression about 1000 m deep in the Strait of Sicily between the SW coast of Sicily and the NE tip of Tunisia, forming submarine banks that are capped by cones that rise to near sea level. Submarine eruptions were reported at the Giulia-Ferdinandeo and Pinne banks during the first Punic war (264-241 BCE), and from the 17th to 20th centuries, sometimes producing ephemeral islands. The 1831 eruption at Graham Island (also known as Graham Bank, Giulia-Ferdinandeo Bank, or Ferdinandea Bank) produced an ephemeral island that was promptly claimed by the navies of France, Britain, Spain, and Italy."
"Amiata","11.630,42.900","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119007.jpg","","Amiata is a lava dome complex located about 20 km NW of Lake Bolsena in the southern Tuscany region of Italy. The 1738-m-high trachydacitic domes and associated lava flows were erupted along regional ENE-WSW-trending faults. The largest of the domes is 1738-m-high Monte Amiata (La Vetta), the 2nd highest volcano in Italy and a compound lava dome with a trachytic lava flow that extends to the east. A massive viscous trachydacitic lava flow, 5 km long and 4 km wide, is part of the basal complex and extends from beneath the southern base of Corno de Bellaria dome. Radiometric dates indicate that the Amiata complex had a major eruptive episode about 300,000 years ago. No eruptive activity has occurred at Amiata during the Holocene, but thermal activity including cinnabar mineralization continues at a producing geothermal field near the town of Bagnore, at the SW end of the dome complex."
"Marsili","14.399,39.284","The Marsili seamount is a 50-km-long volcanic ridge in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea within a back-arc basin about 75-85 km NW of the Aeolian arc volcanoes. Near-source tephra layers obtained from a core sample were determined by Iezzi et al. (2013) to be approximately 3.0 and 5.0 ka BP. Accretion of the ridge is thought to have begun around 1 Ma. Recent data also indicate that there is ongoing hydrothermal activity and shallow volcano-tectonic seismicity."
"Methana","23.336,37.615","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/088009.jpg","","Methana volcano consists of a basaltic-andesite to rhyodacitic lava dome complex forming the Methana Peninsula in the Sarronian Gulf on the NE side of Peloponnesus. Potassium-Argon ages for the older part of the complex range from 900,000 to 550,000 years, although activity may have begun during the late Pliocene. A younger phase of activity took place from about 380,000-290,000 years ago, forming a series of lava domes and flows. The youngest dome, Kameno Vouno, on the NW side of the peninsula, was formed in the 3rd century BCE and produced a lava flow that traveled 500 m beyond the coastline. Hot springs are found at several locations along the coast of the peninsula."
"Milos","24.439,36.699","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/088015.jpg","","Mílos and adjacent small islands have grown from submarine and subaerial volcanism that initially was dominantly andesitic and basaltic, but ended with predominately rhyolitic eruptions. The oldest volcanic rocks are Pliocene submarine rhyolitic pyroclastic-flow deposits overlying basement metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The latest activity during the late Pleistocene was concentrated in the eastern half of the low, U-shaped Mílos Island, forming lava domes and phreatic explosion craters, and on Antimílos Island to the NW, where a composite volcano was constructed. The youngest magmatic eruptions took place about 90,000 years ago, but phreatic explosions, commonly producing overlapping craters rarely more than 1 km in diameter, continued from late-Pleistocene to Recent times. A lahar deposit in SE Mílos, east of Fyriplaka tuff ring, buried walls of a Roman harbor town and overlies a coarse ash layer, and was considered to originate from a small phreatic explosion through basement rocks."

The circular island group is composed of overlapping shield volcanoes cut by at least four partially overlapping calderas. The oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years before present (BP), followed by the Skaros caldera about 70,000 years BP, and then the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years BP. The youngest caldera formed about 3600 years BP during the Late-Bronze-Age Minoan eruption that forced abandonment of the thriving Aegean Sea island. Post-Minoan eruptions beginning in 197 BCE constructed a series of lava domes and flows that form two islands near the center of the caldera. A submarine eruption took place in 1650 AD outside the caldera NE of Thera. The latest eruption at Santorini produced a small lava dome and flow in 1950, accompanied by explosive activity."

Yali is located within the inferred location of the large submarine caldera associated with the eruption of the voluminous Kos Plateau Tuff, dated about 160,000 years before present. This eruption produced extensive ignimbrites that blanket much of the western half of the island of Kos and produced a caldera whose dimensions are uncertain, but which may extend from Kefalos Bay on the SW side of Kos Island to Nisyros Island, south of Yali. The crescent-shaped island of Yali is oriented NNE-SSW and contains two distinct segments connected by a narrow isthmus formed of modern reef sediments. The SW part of the island consists primarily of a layered pumice-fall unit about 200 m thick, and the NE part contains rhyolitic obsidian lava flows of similar thickness. No historical eruptions are known from Yali, but the most recent pumice eruptions of Yali overlie soils containing pottery and Neolithic obsidian artifacts (Keller, 1982)."
"Nisyros","27.160,36.586","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/089100.jpg","","The easternmost volcano of the Aegean arc forms the 9-km-wide island of Nisyros, which is truncated by a 3-4 km wide caldera. The island was constructed during the past 150,000 years, with three cone-building stages including explosive and effusive andesitic eruptions and effusive and extrusive dacitic and rhyolitic activity. The age of the caldera is variously considered to be <24,000 years before present (BP) (Keller et al., 1990) and >44,000 years BP (Limburg and Varekamp, 1991). Five large post-caldera lava domes completely fill the western part of the caldera. The NE-most (Boriatiko) and SW-most (Karaviotis) lava domes and flows are significantly younger than the other domes. A sixth post-caldera dome, outside the SW caldera rim, produced lava flows that reached the coast. Historical phreatic eruptions occurred from craters within the caldera between 1422 and 1888. Intense hydrothermal activity continues in the form of many fumaroles on the caldera floor and hot springs along the coast."
"Kos","27.251,36.852","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/088011.jpg","","The island of Kos is dominantly non-volcanic but contains Miocene to Pleistocene volcanic centers. The Kamari caldera is of mid-Pleistocene age and contains the 1.0-0.55 million-year-old, post-caldera Zini lava dome. The formation of a large caldera deposited the widespread Kos Plateau Tuff (erupted about 160,000 years ago), which blankets much of the western half of Kos and originated from a stratovolcano between Kos and Nisyros islands. The caldera dimensions are uncertain, but may extend as much as 20 km from Kefalos Bay in SW Kos Island to Nisyros Island. Remnants of the pre-eruption stratovolcano are preserved on the islets of Pachia and Pyrgousa and as submarine volcanic rocks on Nisyros. Kos was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Georgalas, 1962) based on its geothermal activity. Several solfatara fields are present, including Vromotopos at Kefalos Isthmus on the western side of the island and a group of thermal areas at the eastern side of Kos. Thermal activity consists of weak hydrogen sulfide emission, sulfur deposits, and two hot springs along the southeastern coast."

The Kula field consists of a broad area of Quaternary alkaline basanitic-to-phonotephritic cinder cones and maars erupted along a roughly E-W-trending line SW of the city of Selendi. Most of the Kula volcanoes are Pleistocene in age, between about 1.1 million and 10,000 years old. The initial stage produced lava flows from vents along the ring fracture of caldera identified from satellite images. The second and third stages took place along an E-W-trending graben and produced lava flows with ultramafic xenoliths. Although activity was considered to have continued until the beginning of the Holocene (Yilmaz, 1990), or almost to historical times (Borsi et al., 1972), the age of the most recent eruption from the Kula field is not known."

The 300-m-high Meke Dagi is one of the largest cinder cones in Central Anatolia. The explosion craters and maars are located along a SW-NE line consistent with the elongation of Karacadag volcano. The maars evolved from hyaloclastite tuff rings to maars to cinder cones, reflecting varying lake water levels during the eruption."
"Hasan Dagi","34.170,38.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015075.jpg","","The massive double-peaked stratovolcano Hasan Dagi in Central Anatolia has undergone four episodes of caldera collapse, the latest of which formed a 4-5 km wide caldera at the summit. The modern edifice is the youngest of four major basaltic-to-rhyolitic volcanic complexes dating back to the mid Miocene and was constructed within the latest caldera. Andesitic-to-dacitic lava domes form the two principal summits, of which the westernmost is the highest and is capped by two nested craters. Lava domes and associated pyroclastic-flow deposits blanket more than half the flanks of the Mount Hasan volcanic complex. A group of more than 25 Quaternary cinder cones, maars, and lava flows dot the plains surrounding Hasan Dagi. Interpretations of neolithic paintings representing eruptions from Hasan Dagi are controversial, but geologic evidence supports eruptive activity continuing into the Holocene."

A large number of cinder cones are located adjacent to Göllü Dag, many along N-S-trending fissures north of the lava dome complex and south of the Erdas Dag massif; some of these cones were considered by Keller (1980, pers. comm.) to be Holocene in age due to their freshly preserved features. The lava domes and cinder cones overlie the buried silicic Derinkuyu caldera complex of Tertiary age; hydrothermal alteration and hot springs are present in the Sahin Kalesi resurgent dome complex west of Göllü Dag and on the southern flank of the Erdas Dag massif to the north."

Three groups of obsidian lava flows have been dated; pre-collapse flows between about 190,000 and 180,000 years before present (BP), 75,000 yrs BP lava domes (such as Taskesik Tepe on the eastern side of the caldera) post-dating formation of the Acigöl-Nevsehir caldera, and young lava domes on the western caldera floor about 20,000 to 15,000 years old. Thirteen scoria layers from local tephras erupted between about 11,000 and 4300 years ago were found in sediment cores in the late Pleistocene Eski Acigöl maar. An ash layer from the Acigöl-Nevsehir volcanic group overlies 2300-1850 BCE artifacts of Roman-Cappadocian age."
"Karaca Dag","39.830,37.670","Karaca Dag (also known as Karacalidag) is a broad, 1957-m-high basaltic shield volcano in SE Turkey about 100 km north of the Syrian border. The volcano lies on the Arabian foreland about 150 km SW of the boundary with the Anatolian Plate and has been active since the Pliocene along a N-S-trending set of fissures and craters associated with the nearby Akcakale graben. Potassium-Argon dates of mid-Pleistocene age have been obtained from Karaca Dag lava flows, but Landsat imagery suggests that some lava flows, particularly those on the east flank, may perhaps be only a few thousand years old (Pearce et al., 1990)."
"Erciyes Dagi","35.480,38.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/015074.jpg","","The massive, eroded stratovolcano Erciyes Dagi at the northern end of the Sultansazligi Basin in central Anatolia covers an area of about 1300 sq km. Growth of the modern volcano began about 0.9 million years ago, following Pliocene caldera collapse of the Kocdag complex. Numerous parasitic cones and lava domes are found mostly on the north flank of the modern edifice, many along radial fissures. The youngest dated rock was from an 83,000-year-old dacitic lava flow, but rhyodacitic eruptions and lava dome growth occurred later at the Perikartin dome. One of the latest documented events was an edifice collapse that produced a large debris avalanche that extended to the east. An early Holocene distal tephra layer in Lebanon was attributed to Erciyes Dagi. Uncertainty remains regarding reported historical eruptions of Erciyes Dagi and their possible depiction on Roman Cappadocian coins. Historical accounts possibly referring to eruptions could also be attributed to methane releases from a swamp in the Sultansazligi Basin."
"Nemrut Dagi","42.229,38.654","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104036.jpg","","Nemrut Dagi is the westernmost of a group of volcanoes near Lake Van in eastern Anatolia and the only one that has erupted in historical time. It contains a 9 x 5 km caldera partially filled on its western side by a caldera lake. Post-caldera volcanism, of basaltic to rhyolitic composition, initially occurred along the caldera rim and floor. Pyroclastic flows and the emission of glassy obsidian lava flows accompanied construction of lava domes within the caldera; later activity formed a series of cinder cones and lava domes erupted along N-S-trending fissures on the northern flank. The most recent activity has been concentrated along a NNW-trending fissure cutting the eastern caldera floor and extending beyond the north caldera rim; nearly two dozen cinder cones and lava domes were constructed on the caldera floor. Ash layers in Lake Van document numerous Holocene eruptions, and an historical eruption in 1441 CE from a N-flank fissure involved compositionally bimodal lava flows."
"Tenduruk Dagi","43.874,39.356","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117056.jpg","","Tendürek Dagi, also known as Tendürük Dagi, is an elongated shield volcano that rises 1800 m above the plain of Dogubayazit, near the Iranian border, south of Mount Ararat. An E-W-trending summit ridge, developed north of an arcuate caldera structure exposed only on the southern side, contains two well-developed cones. The higher western cone is capped by a steep-walled crater with a trachytic spine at its eastern edge. The flatter eastern crater contains a warm lake. The shield volcano developed during a period when highly mobile lava flows from the western crater covered an area of 500 sq km. Following summit caldera formation, numerous flank eruptions took place from N-S-trending fissures, producing viscous trachytic lava domes and flows as well as fluid basaltic pahoehoe flows that extend 10-20 km to the north and south. The latest activity formed two major basaltic lava flows from large cones on the NE and SE flanks. An eruption took place from a vent on the SE flank about 2500 years ago, and a gas-and-ash eruption took place in 1855."

Glacier-clad Ararat, along with its twin volcano, 3925-m-high Kucuk Ararat (or Lesser Ararat), covers an area of 1000 sq km at the eastern end of a SSW-ESE line of volcanoes extending from Nemrut Dagi. Construction of the Greater and Lesser Ararat volcanoes was followed by a period of extensive flank eruptions, many erupted along N-S-trending fissures. The initial stage of flank eruptions produced a cluster of cinder cones and dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes surrounding Greater Ararat and a series of pyroclastic cones and domes on the western flank of Lesser Ararat. Late-stage activity formed large pyroclastic cones lower on the flanks of the two volcanoes. Ararat appears to have been active during the 3rd millennium BCE; pyroclastic-flow deposits overlie early Bronze Age artifacts and human remains. Karakhanian et al. (2002) reported historical evidence for a phreatic eruption and pyroclastic flow at the time of a July 1840 earthquake and landslide."

The 5621-m-high eastern summit has a 250-m-wide, well-preserved crater, separated by a low saddle from the 5642-m-high western summit. Eruptive products cover 260 sq km; its longest lava flow traveled 24 km down the NNE flank. The most recent lava flows are fresh-looking, and the latest eruptions took place during the Holocene (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World). Weak solfataric activity near the summit continues, and hot springs are present on the flanks."

Next to Mount Elbrus, it is the highest volcano in Caucasus Mountains. The summit cone and the latest lava flows are of post-glacial age, and the latest andesitic-dacitic lava flow was radiocarbon dated at about 6000 years ago. Gushchenko (1979) listed an 800-700 BCE eruption."
"Samsari Volcanic Center","43.700,41.542","The Samsari Volcanic Center consists of more than 20 volcanoes extedning about 40 km N-S along the Samsari Ridge, part of the Dzhakheti Highland of southern Georgis, about 90 km WSW of Tbilisi. The most prominent volcanoes are Shavnabada in the north, the Samsari Caldera, and Didi-Abuli in the south. K-Ar dates obtained by Lebedev et al. (2003) showed that the oldest rocks were about 400 ka, from Didi-Abuli; the Samsari caldera was active around 200 ka. One sample from Tavkvetili volcano, a feature with a well-preserved crater at the far northern edge of the range, dated to <30 ka. A lava flow from Godorebi volcano, just north of Didi-Abuli, had a similar date."
"Aragats","44.200,40.530","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101041.jpg","","Aragats is a large andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcano in NW Armenia about 40 km NW of the capital city of Yerevan. The 4095-m-high main edifice is dissected by glaciers and is of Pliocene-to-Pleistocene age. Satellitic cones and fissures are located on all sides of the volcano and were the source of large lava flows that descended its lower flanks. Several of these were considered to be of Holocene age, but later Potassium-Argon dating indicated mid- to late-Pleistocene ages. The youngest lower-flank flows have not been precisely dated, but are constrained as occurring between the end of the late-Pleistocene and 3000 BCE (Kharakanian et al., 2003). A 13-km-long, WSW-ENE-trending line of craters and pyroclastic cones cuts across the northern crater rim and is the source of young lava flows and lahars; the latter were considered to be characteristic of Holocene summit eruptions."

The volcanoes and associated lava flows cover a 65-km-long, 35-km-wide area west of Lake Sevan and south of the Hrazdan River and are concentrated along 3 NNW-SSE-trending alignments. Lava flows from the central and eastern clusters flowed into Lake Sevan. Initial explosive eruptions in the volcanic field were followed by the extrusion of rhyolitic obsidian lava domes and flows. The latest activity produced a series of andesitic and basaltic-andesite cinder cones and lava flows. The central and eastern portions of the Ghegam Ridge contains large areas of Holocene eruptions with morphologically fresh lava flows devoid of vegetation."
"Dar-Alages","45.551,39.704","A group of six cinder and lava cones of Pleistocene-to-Holocene age is located in southern Armenia on the western slopes of the Vardenis volcanic highland south of Lake Sevan. The andesitic Dar-Alages, also known as Daly-Tapa, formed in postglacial times (Sviatlovsky, 1959). The Vaiyots-Sar and Smbatassar pyroclastic cones of Holocene age (Karakhanian et al., 2002) are located in this part of the highland. Vaiyots-Sar lies just north of the major Areni-Zanghezour Fault, near the town of Vaik, and produced a fissure-fed lava flow several thousand years ago that dammed the Arpah River and flowed to the west for 6 km. The youthful-looking Smbatassar cinder cone is 17 km NW and produced lava flows that traveled 11 km N and 17 km S."
"Porak","45.740,40.028","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112036.jpg","","The mid-Pleistocene Porak volcano lies in the Vardenis volcanic highland about 20 km SE of Lake Sevan. The volcanic field straddles the Armenia/Azerbaijan border, and lava flows extend into both countries. The flanks are dotted with 10 satellitic cones and fissure vents. It was constructed along the active Pambak-Sevan strike-slip fault, which has bisected the mid-Pleistocene Khonarassar volcano, separating its two halves by about 800 m. Two large lava flows traveled up to 21 km north and NW, and fresh-looking lava flows form peninsulas extending into Lake Alagyol. Fifth century BCE petroglyphs were interpreted to depict volcanic eruptions (Karakhanian et al., 2002). Porak is referred to in a famous cuneiform inscription as Mount Bamni, and stratigraphic and archeological evidence indicates that an explosive eruption also producing a lava flow occurred at the time of a military battle dated to 782-773 BCE."
"Tskhouk-Karckar","46.020,39.730","A group of pyroclastic cones is located in the central part of the Siunik volcanic ridge along the Armenia/Azerbaijan border about 60 km SE of Lake Sevan. The Tskhouk-Karckar volcano group was constructed within offset segments of the major Pambak-Sevan strike-slip fault trending SE from Lake Sevan. Eight pyroclastic cones produced three generations of Holocene lava flows (Karakhanian et al., 2002). Abundant petroglyphs, burial kurgans, and masonry walls were found on flows of the older two age groups, but not on the youngest. Lava flows from cinder cones of the Tskhouk-Karckar volcano group overlie petroglyphs dated to the end of the 4th millennium and beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE and are themselves used in gravesites dated at 4720 +/- 140 yrs ago. Following these eruptions, the area was not repopulated until the Middle Ages."
"Tair, Jebel at","41.830,15.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119001.jpg","","The basaltic Jebel at Tair volcano rises from a 1200 m depth in the south-central Red Sea, forming an oval-shaped island about 3 km long. Jebel at Tair (one of many variations of the name, including Djebel Teyr, Jabal al Tayr, and Jibbel Tir ) is the northernmost known Holocene volcano in the Red Sea and lies SW of the Farisan Islands. Youthful basaltic pahoehoe lava flows from the steep-sided central vent, Jebel Duchan, cover most of the island. They drape a circular cliff cut by wave erosion of an older edifice and extend beyond it to form a flat coastal plain. Pyroclastic cones are located along the NW and southern coasts, and fumarolic activity occurs from two uneroded scoria cones at the summit. Radial fissures extend from the summit, some of which were the sources of lava flows. The island is of Holocene age, and explosive eruptions were reported in the 18th and 19th centuries."

This island group, in contrast to other Red Sea islands such as Jebel at Tair or the Zubair Islands, lies in shallow waters south of the Red Sea median trough. Products of phreatic eruptions at Zukur form small islands and coastal cones. Late-stage trachytic lava domes produced viscous lava flows. Vents on Zukur are aligned along a NE-SW trend."
"Hanish","42.730,13.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117023.jpg","","The Hanish Islands are formed from a series of volcanic vents along a NE-SW trend, and include the Holocene Great Hanish, Little Hanish, and many other small islands and submarine shoals. The Zukur-Hanish island group, in contrast to other Red Sea islands such as Jebel at Tair or the Zubair Islands, lies in shallow waters south of the Red Sea median trough. Spatter cones, cinder cones, and ash cones line the crest of the 20-km-long Great Hanish island. Short lava flows reach the coast on both sides of the island. As with the Zukur group to the north, initial eruptions were phreatic. Subsequently basaltic cinder cones were formed, and spatter cones produced fluid lava flows."

The platform and eruptive vents forming the islands and shoals of the Zubair Group are oriented NNW-SSE, parallel to the rift. An early explosive phase was followed by a brief period of marine erosion, and then by renewed explosive activity accompanied by the extrusion of basaltic pahoehoe lava flows. This latest phase of activity occurred on the morphologically youngest islands of Zubair, Centre Peak, Saba, and Haycock. Historical explosive activity was reported from Saddle Island in the 19th century. Spatter cones and pyroclastic cones were erupted along fissures that form the low spine of Zubair Island."
"Jalua","39.820,15.042","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111078.jpg","","Jalua, the northernmost volcano in the Eritrea/Ethiopia area, occupies an isolated location in the arid Danakil depression. It contains a large, central volcanotectonic depression that is open to the Zula Gulf and an isolated central cone. Jalua lies NW of basaltic lava flows of the Alid graben and south of the Zula Gulf. No historical eruptions are known, although fumarolic activity continues on its western flank. The nomenclature of volcanic features in the Afar region reflects that of the two dominant ethnic groups, the Afar (on the Ethiopian side) and the Issas (in the SE Afar depression). Each group has their own names for physiographic features, and consequently more than one name may apply to the same feature. A similar situation occurs throughout Ethiopia, where names often reflect local politics."

These craters mark Earth's lowest known subaerial volcanic vents. The most recent of these craters, Dallol, lies 48 m below sea level and was formed during an eruption in 1926. Colorful hot brine springs are found in the Dallol area. Another phreatic explosion was observed in January 2011."
"Alid","39.920,14.880","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/059054.jpg","","Alid is an isolated, dissected volcano in the central Danakil depression. The volcano is elongated in an E-W direction perpendicular to the orientation of the Alid graben. Alid consists of a structural dome of uplifted sedimentary rocks, capped by basaltic-to-rhyolitic lava flows, that rises 700 m above the graben floor. Late-stage rhyolitic eruptions during the late Pleistocene ejected rhyolitic pumice. Steep-sided lava flows drape the flanks of the structural dome, which was produced by intrusion of a silicic magma body. A 2 x 3 km graben cuts the top of the dome, and the crater that produced the plinian eruption occupies the western third of the summit depression. Vast lava fields of probable Holocene age originating from fissure vents bank up against the flanks of Alid to the NW and SE. Small cones and craters that were the source of the flows are localized along NNW-trending fissures. Fumarolic activity continues from broad areas on the northern summit and flank."
"Gada Ale","40.408,13.975","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/099005.jpg","","Gada Ale, also known as Kebrit Ale, is the most prominent volcano at the northern end of the Erta Ale Range. It is formed of interstratified lava flows and hyaloclastites. Fumarolic activity is continuing, and a small lake filled by boiling mud occupies the crater. Like other Erta Ale Range volcanoes, Gada Ale is considered to be of Holocene age (Barberi and Varet, 1970). A fissure on the SE flank has produced spatter cones and a cinder cone; the latter fed lava flows that reach to Lake Bakili. The symmetrical Catherine tuff ring is located along this same SE trend west of Lake Bakili, and other tuff rings occur on the east side of the lake. A 2-km-wide salt dome west of Gada Ale has uplifted lava flows as much as 100 m, and the structure of Gada Ale itself also appears to be related to salt diapir uplift."

Recent fractures along the axis of the Erta Ale range cut the main horst of Alu and areas to the SSE. Major fumarolic activity is located on the numerous parallel faults, some of which have uplifts of 100 m. Fissure vents west of the horst have fed silicic lava flows, and voluminous youthful basaltic lava flows to the east extend north as far as Lake Bakili. Dalafilla, also referred to as Gabuli, is a steep-sided cone that rises 300 m above surrounding lava fields due to extrusion of viscous, silicic lava flows that extend primarily to the east. Basaltic lava flows from regional fissures surround the volcano. Fumarolic activity occurs in the 100-m-wide summit crater and has weathered surrounding lava flows. The first historical eruption of Alu-Dalafilla took place in 2008, when lava flows from vents between the two edifices traveled NE."

The earliest activity formed submarine lava flows partially covered by Quaternary reef deposits. An embryonic shield volcano is located on the SW side of the complex and is cut by curvilinear faults; youthful chains of spatter cones follow this same curvilinear pattern and form concentric semi-circles. The 668-m-high summit is located on the NE side of the massif and consists of a silicic stratovolcano that is the largest of the Erte Ale Range. It has produced steep-sided viscous lava flows that have traveled up to 5 km from the volcano. Strong fumarolic activity occurs within a 300-m-wide summit crater. Regional faulting has fed very recent basaltic lava flows from a NNW-trending fissure that cuts the stratovolcano."

The 613-m-high volcano contains a 0.7 x 1.6 km, elliptical summit crater housing steep-sided pit craters. Another larger 1.8 x 3.1 km wide depression elongated parallel to the trend of the Erta Ale range is located to the SE of the summit and is bounded by curvilinear fault scarps on the SE side. Fresh-looking basaltic lava flows from these fissures have poured into the caldera and locally overflowed its rim. The summit caldera is renowned for one, or sometimes two long-term lava lakes that have been active since at least 1967, or possibly since 1906. Recent fissure eruptions have occurred on the northern flank."

A small, roughly 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep steep-walled caldera is found at the summit of the 1611-m-high volcano. Basaltic lava flows are prominent on the E side of the volcano, and satellite vents are located on the SE flank. The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (1973) listed Sork Ale as probably active during the last 2000 years, but Wood (1980 pers. comm.) considered Holocene activity unlikely.

The two most-recent eruptive centers are fissure systems that extend NW-SE and NNE-SSW. The former produced lava flows that reached the Red Sea in 1400 CE. The second created 19 small craters at the summit in 1861. Ash fell more than 300 km from the volcano. Two villages were destroyed and more than 100 persons were killed during Africa's largest eruption in historical time. Lava flows from the 1861 eruption traveled as far as 22 km and reached the coast."
"Ma Alalta","40.185,13.013","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111080.jpg","","The Ma Alalta volcano, also known as Pierre Pruvost, is an 1815-m-high stratovolcano located well to the west of the Danakil depression at the foot of the regional Ethiopian scarp. It is situated between two large horsts of uplifted basement blocks. A large trachytic and rhyolitic stratovolcano at the center of the complex contains nested oval-shaped summit calderas, 8 x 5 km and 5 x 2.5 km wide. Ignimbrite deposits, perhaps associated with formation of the larger caldera, extend beyond the volcano primarily to the NE and SE. Young basaltic lava flows were erupted on the NW, SE, and E flanks of the volcano. Recent silicic activity has produced pantelleritic obsidian domes and lava flows on the southern flank. Fumarolic activity continues at one of the domes."
"Alayta","40.573,12.888","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111081.jpg","","The massive Alayta shield volcano covers an area of 2700 sq km in the western Danakil depression SW of Lake Afrera. A series of very recent craters is aligned along the NNW-trending axis of the basaltic-to-trachytic shield. The lava field, covered by very fresh flows, was erupted from N-S-trending fissures along the east side of the shield volcano and laps up against the western flank of Afderà volcano. Two historical eruptions that were formerly attributed to Afderà actually originated from Alayta. One of those eruptions, in 1907, produced a large lava flow from a SE-flank vent. Fumarolic activity occurs at two locations in the southern part of the complex."
"Dabbahu","40.480,12.595","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115083.jpg","","Dabbahu (also known as Boina, Boyna, or Moina) is a Pleistocent-to-Holocene volcanic massif forming an axial range of the Afar depression SSW of the Alayta massif. Late-stage pantelleritic obsidian flows, lava domes, and pumice cones form the summit and upper flanks of the volcano, which rises above the Teru Plain and was built over a volumetrically dominant base of basaltic-to-trachyandesitic lava flows of a shield volcano. Late-stage basaltic fissure eruptions also occurred at the NW base of the volcano. Abundant fumaroles are located along the crest of the volcano and extend NE towards Alayta volcano. The first historical eruption of Dabbahu took place from a fissure vent on the NE flank in September 2005, producing ashfall deposits and a small pumice dome. More than 6000 persons were evacuated from neighboring villages."
"Dabbayra","40.070,12.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111083.jpg","","Dabbayra, the westernmost volcano of the Afar depression, was constructed along an offshoot of the Ethiopian escarpment, SW of the Teru plain. In contrast to structural trends in other parts of Afar, Dabbayra (also known as Bar-Ali) consists of a basaltic shield volcano elongated in an ENE-WSW direction. The only silicic volcanic rocks are a NNW-trending line of lava domes and lava flows near the crest of the 1302-m-high volcano."
"Manda Hararo","40.820,12.170","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119049.jpg","","The southernmost axial range of western Afar, the Manda Hararo complex is located in the Kalo plain, SSE of Dabbahu volcano. The massive complex is 105 km long and 20-30 km wide, and represents an uplifted segment of a mid-ocean ridge spreading center. A small basaltic shield volcano is located at the northern end of the complex, south of which is an area of abundant fissure-fed lava flows. Two basaltic shield volcanoes, the largest of which is Unda Hararo, occupy the center of the complex. The dominant part of the complex lies to the south, where the Gumatmali-Gablaytu fissure system is located. Voluminous fluid lava flows issued from these NNW-trending fissures, and solidified lava lakes occupy two large craters. The small Gablaytu shield volcano forms the SE-most end of the Manda Hararo complex. Lava flows from Gablaytu and from Manda overlie 8000-year-old sediments. Hot springs and fumaroles occur around Daorre lake. The first historical eruptions of Manda Hararo produced fissure-fed lava flows in 2007 and 2009."
"Groppo","40.250,11.730","Groppo volcano is a small 930-m-high alkali rhyolitic stratovolcano located in the western Afar near the Ethiopian escarpment, NE of Dessye. The volcano was considered to have been active during the past 2000 years (IAVCEI, 1973)."

It lies at the intersection of three fault systems. Young rhyolitic lava domes are aligned N-S at its southern foot. Only a few late-stage satellitic cones are of basaltic composition. Eruptions were reported in 1907 and 1915 (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World). However, on morphological grounds it appears to be substantially older than adjacent volcanoes, and the reported eruptions were probably from Alayta volcano to the west. The age of the most recent eruption is not known, although the S-flank rhyolitic lava domes are too young to be dated by the Potassium-Argon method."
"Manda Gargori","41.480,11.750","The Manda Gargori rift, located north of the town of Aisa Aita NE of Borawli volcano and SE of Kurub volcano, is the youngest rift segment in the Afar depression and is only one third the width of the adjacent Manda Hararo-Goba'ad rift system to the west. Two older lava flows from the Manda Gargori rift have Pleistocene potassium-argon dates. Youthful-looking lava flows, some of which may have been subaqueous, have been emitted from NNW-trending fissures. A hyaloclastite tuff ring is also present, and a rhyolitic lava dome surrounded by two basaltic lava flows is located north of Uddummi lake. No historical activity has been reported at the dominantly basaltic Manda Gargori rift, but human footprints have been observed in a fresh ashfall deposit, and the eruptive activity is considered to be of historical age."
"Borawli","41.450,11.630","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111074.jpg","","The Borawli complex consists of a group of rhyolitic lava domes on the floor of the southern Kali plain, NE of the town of Aisa Aita. A Pleistocene date was obtained from the southernmost lava flow of Borawli. A 1631 eruption (sometimes listed as 1627) attributed possibly to Amado dome (United Nations, 1973) was considered more likely to be from Dama Ali (Gouin, 1979). This 875-m-high dome complex is one of several volcanic features in Ethiopia named Borawli."

The elongated complex represents an uplifted mid-ocean ridge spreading center now exposed above sea level. An elongated dome of basement rocks is cut by two axial rifts, the northern of which was active during historical time. Basaltic cinder cones along marginal faults of the rift have produced lava flows that traveled down the flanks of the structural dome, producing a shield-like morphology. An eruption in 1928 or 1929 at the SE end of the Manda-Inakir rift near the town of Korili (in Djibouti) produced the Kammourta cinder cone and a lava flow."

The massive lava field covers a 55 x 90 km area, and flows reached the Red Sea along a broad front. The vents of the Assab volcanic field, also known as Ado Ale or Ud'ale, were constructed along a broad E-W-trending line that extends to the coastal city of Assab."
"Ardoukôba","42.470,11.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104004.jpg","","The Ardoukôba (Asal) Rift in Djibouti, trending NW from the Red Sea, contains a broad area of youthful fissure vents between Lake Asal and the Ghoubbat al Kharab gulf. The rift is subaerially exposed over a 12 km distance between these two bodies of water and contains numerous basaltic cinder and spatter cones. The silicic centers of Eger Alayta and Asa Aleyta, on the north and south sides of the rift, are remnants of a Pleistocene silicic center that has been disrupted and spread apart by the rift. Magma-water interaction has produced tuff cones, some of which form islands or are breached by the sea. The most recent lava flows are younger than lake sediments deposited 5300 years ago. These lavas were thought to have been erupted during the past 3000 years (Delibrias et al., 1975). The Ardoukôba fissure erupted in 1978, producing a small cinder cone and lava flows that covered part of the rift floor near the Red Sea."

The easternmost lava flow of Kurub volcano was potassium-argon dated at about 0.3 million years. Wind-blown sand fills the summit crater of the very recent basaltic volcano. Initial subaqueous activity occurred along NNW-trending fissures. Fumarolic activity observed in the 1930s was not seen during field work in the 1970s."
"Dama Ali","41.630,11.280","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111070.jpg","","Dama Ali is a broad shield volcano that rises above the NW shore of Lake Abbe (also known as Lake Abhe) in eastern Ethiopia. The 25-km-wide volcano was constructed at the southern end of the Kalo Plain. Nested circular craters are located at the summit of the dominantly basaltic volcano, which also displays an older caldera rim. An arcuate chain of rhyolitic lava domes occupies the northern, western, and southern flanks. Youthful basaltic lava flows surround these domes and blanket the flanks of the volcano, and recent flows cover the young sediments of the Kalo and Abhe basins. The Asmara basaltic pyroclastic cone located in the southern Kalo basin SW of the base of the volcano was considered to have had activity during the last 2000 years (International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, 1973). It is considered the most likely source of an eruption reported to have occurred in 1631 (Gouin, 1979). Major fumarolic activity occurs in the summit crater, and abundant hot springs are found on the volcano."

Rhyolitic lava domes are located on the flanks, and a 5 x 17 km basaltic lava field that covers the Ado Bad plain north of the volcano originated from a broad area of fissure vents and spatter cones on the north side of Gabillema. Young lava flows also occur south and east of the volcano, the latter along E-W-trending fissures. This period of rejuvenation, perhaps not directly related to Gabillema, has included rhyolitic as well as basaltic volcanism."

Adwa is younger than the vegetated Ayelu and is a stratovolcano with a 4 x 5 km caldera that originated following eruption of voluminous ignimbrites. A small 2.5-km-wide caldera cuts a trachytic dome extruded in the older caldera. Scoria cones are located on the floor of a circular summit caldera and on its NW and SW flanks. Extensive young basaltic lava flows cover the flanks of Adwa and overlap a sedimentary plain to the SE. Many fumaroles occur within the caldera. Satellitic pyroclastic cones and lava domes were considered to be only a few hundred years old (Mohr 1980, pers. comm.)."

It consists primarily of rhyolitic obsidian lava flows with minor tuffs. Welded pantelleritic ash flows accompanied formation of a 2.5 x 4.5 km summit caldera, which has steep-sided walls up to 500 m high. The WNW-ESE-trending elliptical caldera has an orientation perpendicular to the Ethiopian Rift, and post-caldera vents occur along the same orientation. Trachytic and obsidian lava flows occur on the caldera floor, and fresh-looking lava flows descend the flanks from satellitic vents. An eruption from Fentale during the 13th century destroyed an Abyssinian town and church south of the volcano. In 1820 basaltic lava flows were extruded onto the Main Ethiopian Rift from a 4-km-long fissure on the south flank, and lava flows were erupted on the floor of the caldera."

Initial basaltic-to-trachytic activity at Boset (also known as Gudda) was followed by rhyolitic effusive and explosive eruptions that resulted in caldera formation. A remnant of the caldera rim is found on the NW flank of Boset. Elsewhere post-caldera activity has produced very recent pantelleritic obsidian fissure-fed lava domes and flows that have buried the caldera wall, and flank eruptions from fissures parallel to the rift have produced voluminous pantelleritic lava flows. Bericha (also known as Bariccia) has produced similar very recent obsidian flows and associated pumice flows. Fissures connecting Boset and Bericha have erupted youthful, prehistorical basaltic lava flows."

"Tosa Sucha","37.570,5.930","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115044.jpg","","A group of cinder cones at Tosa Sucha on the north shore of Lake Chamo in the southern Ethiopian Rift has produced unvegetated olivine basaltic lava flows and may have been active as recently as historical time (Ebinger et al., 1993). The cones and flows on the eastern end of the Chamo Basin were erupted along NNE-trending fissures between Lake Chamo and Lake Abaya to the north. Some cones form islands in Lake Chamo."
"Unnamed","37.670,5.650","A group of unnamed cinder cones erupted from NNE-trending fissures SE of Lake Chamo, along the southern Ethiopian Rift, has produced unvegetated olivine basaltic lava flows that may have erupted as recently as historical time (Ebinger et al., 1993)."
"Korath Range","35.880,5.100","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114100.jpg","","The Korath Range is an isolated group of tuff cones and lava flows in southern Ethiopia that were erupted along the Turkana Rift, which extends north from Kenya. About 20 tuff cones occupy the Korath Range, many of which issued lava flows from their flanks that traveled up to about 5 km. The apparent youngest flow issued from the central crater and flowed through a breach in its rim. The absolute age of the dominantly basanitic-tephritic lava flows is unknown, but a shell adhering to the youngest flow was radiocarbon dated at 7900 years before present (BP) (Brown et al., 1969). Davidson (1983) indicated an age between 30,000 BP and 7900-9500 BP."
"Mega Basalt Field","37.420,4.080","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115020.jpg","","The Mega Basalt field, straddling the Ethiopia-Kenya border, is referred to in Kenya as the Dukana volcanic field. The Ethiopian portion was considered to have been active during the Holocene (Mohr, 1979; Davidson, 1983). The Kenyan portion was mapped as Pleistocene in age, with one Potassium-Argon date of about 0.9 million years ago (Charsely, 1987). The 1.8-km-wide Gof Dukana basaltic maar is surrounded by ejecta containing abundant basement igneous and metamorphic rocks. About 50 pyroclastic cones with associated lava flows rise to about 150 m above the lava platform in northern Kenya."
"North Island","36.050,4.070","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100044.jpg","","The small, 2-km-wide North Island in Lake Turkana is the northernmost and smallest of three volcanic islands in the lake. North Island is the summit of Kenya's northernmost rift valley volcano and is primarily composed of trachyandesitic-to-trachytic phreatomagmatic deposits from overlapping eroded tuff cones or tuff rings. The center of the island consists of a young tuff ring about 1 km in diameter nested inside an older tuff ring. Two fresh unvegetated lava flows that reach the lake shore from the central tuff ring form lava deltas at the northern and western sides of the island; the northern delta is about 900 m wide. The two blocky lava flows are younger than a terrace that formed less than 10,000 years ago during the last major high-water level of Lake Turkana (Key and Watkins, 1988). Geothermal activity occurs along a curvilinear ridge on the southern half of the island and on wave-cut platforms and beaches on the SW shoreline."
"Central Island","36.042,3.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100043.jpg","","Central Island, also known as Crocodile Island, occupies the middle of Lake Turkana and is composed of more than a dozen craters and cones, three of which are filled by small lakes. The two largest lakes partially fill craters up to a km wide and about 80 m deep whose floors lie near sea level. The highest point on the dominantly basaltic island reaches 550 m, about 170 m above the lake surface. An E-W-trending chain of small explosion craters cuts the eastern side of the 3-km-wide island. Several small islands to the SE represent partially submerged crater rims, and other cones and lava plugs lie beneath the lake surface near the island. The youngest Central Islands tuffs and lavas may be as young as Holocene (Karson and Curtis, 1992). Fumarolic activity is concentrated along the NE-to-SE rim of the central crater, and sprays of sulfur from the fumaroles were observed by visitors in the 1930s. In 1974 intense emission of molten sulfur and steam clouds were seen from the mainland."
"Marsabit","37.970,2.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104034.jpg","","Marsabit is a massive, 6300 sq km basaltic shield volcano located 170 km east of the center of the East African Rift. Its slopes are dotted with 22 maars and 180 cinder cones, most of which are concentrated along NW- and NE-trending belts that cut across the thickly vegetated summit region. The main phase of shield construction occurred during the Pliocene. Quaternary activity shifted to explosive activity that formed maars accompanied by further extensive effusion of lava flows. The youngest dated lava flow at Marsabit has a Potassium-Argon age of 0.68 +/- 0.16 million years ago, but more recent activity has also occurred. The youngest lava flows are unvegetated, and Key (1987) mapped the post-shield cinder cones as Pleistocene to Recent in age."
"South Island","36.600,2.630","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119031.jpg","","The southernmost and largest of the three volcanic islands in Lake Turkana, South Island contains numerous tuff cones. Fresh-looking lava flows, erupted from a N-S fissure extending the 11-km length of the island, form much of the eastern shoreline. South Island (sometimes referred to as Hohnel Island) rises 320 m above the lake to a height of 800 m and is part of a volcanic horst that extends 10 km to the north beneath the lake surface. Early stage tuff cone formation may have been associated with a high stand of Lake Turkana dated at about 10,000 years ago, and later subaerial activity postdates the last high stand of the lake about 3200 years ago. The dominantly basaltic lava flows are morphologically similar to the youthful Holocene flows of The Barrier volcano at the south end of Lake Turkana. An eruption from a scoria cone on South Island was witnessed during Count von Teliki's 1888 expedition."
"Barrier, The","36.570,2.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100042.jpg","","The Barrier volcanic complex separates Lake Turkana from the broad Suguta Trough to the south, the site of a former lake. The volcano is comprised of four overlapping shield volcanoes, with the youngest, Kakorinya, located over the axis of the East African Rift. Kalolenyang volcano lies west of Kakorinya, and Likaiu West and Likaiu East volcano are located to the ENE. A 3.8-km-wide summit caldera was formed at Kakorinya volcano about 92,000 years ago. Youthful-looking trachytic and phonolitic lava domes and flows erupted within the caldera and along its ring fracture fill much of the caldera floor. Early Holocene fissure-related scoria cones and lava flows dot the volcano's southern and northern flanks. Solfataric fields are located within the caldera and on the western and southern flanks of the volcano. Historical eruptions from Teleki's and Andrew's cones on the northern and southern flanks, respectively, have produced basaltic explosive activity and lava flows during the 19th and 20th centuries."
"Namarunu","36.430,1.980","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100041.jpg","","The largely Pliocene Namarunu trachytic shield volcano is topped by parasitic cones and lava flows of upper Pleistocene and Holocene age. Voluminous basaltic effusive and explosive activity took place during the early Holocene on the lower northern, eastern, and southern flanks along the axis of the East African Rift, producing fissure-controlled subaerial basaltic scoria cones and lava flows, and partially or completely sublacustral tuff cones, tuff rings, and pillow lavas. Fluid olivine basalts were also erupted from a breached scoria cone forming the summit of Namarunu. The youngest eruptions postdated the drying out of Lake Sugata about 3000 years ago. Some could be as recent as the historical eruptions at The Barrier volcano to the north (Dunkley et al., 1993). Hot springs are located on some of the young volcanic cones on the rift valley floor and on the eastern side of the rift along the base of the Tirr Tirr Plateau."
"Segererua Plateau","37.900,1.570","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117039.jpg","","A large number of late-Pleistocene to Holocene basaltic cones, lava flows, and maars occur along a roughly 50-km-long NE-SW trend on the Segererua and Rusarus Plateaus and areas to the SW. This volcanic region is located well east of the East African Rift, south of the massive Marsabit shield volcano. The two plateaus host most of the vents and are bounded by the Milgis River on the north and the Merille River to the south. Other vents lie to the SW, east of the Kauro River, and another large area of basaltic lava flows lies west of the Segererua and Rusaurus Platueas."
"Emuruangogolak","36.330,1.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100040.jpg","","The broad Emuruangogolak shield volcano is situated at a narrow constriction in the Gregory Rift and almost completely straddles it. A 5 x 3.5 km summit caldera formed about 38,000 years ago. Since then trachytic and basaltic lava flows were erupted on the northern and southern flanks and within the caldera. A NNE-SSW-trending chain of lake-filled basaltic maars extends along the floor of the rift from the lower flanks of the volcano. Young lava flows were also erupted from vents along rift valley faults. Well-preserved parasitic cones erupted along rift-parallel faults cutting the volcano abound; the latest eruption produced a trachytic lava flow dated from secular magnetic variation measurements at about the beginning of the 20th century. Fumarolic activity and hot steaming ground occurs along NNE-trending fissures within the caldera and along the lower NW flanks."
"Silali","36.230,1.150","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100039.jpg","","The 30-km-wide Silali trachytic shield volcano, the largest Quaternary volcano in the northern Gregory Rift, completely straddles the East African Rift. An impressive 5 x 8 km summit caldera with 300 m deep walls is thought to have formed about 63,000 years ago. Caldera formation is thought to have been incremental, related to eruption of the Kantenmening basaltic and trachytic lava flows. A series of summit-area lava benches formed by eruptions from circumferential fissures has produced a volcano morphologically similar to Galapagos Islands volcanoes. Northern, eastern, and southern flanks are cut by a prominent broad rift zone 10-km wide and 30-km long, dotted with numerous pyroclastic cones. Lava domes on the upper eastern flank formed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, until about 7 ka. Youthful parasitic cones abound on the caldera floor and on the northern and NE flanks; the youngest lava flows may be little more than a few hundred years old (Williams et al. 1984). Geothermal activity occurs within the caldera and on the upper eastern flanks."
"Paka","36.180,0.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100038.jpg","","The dominantly Pleistocene Paka shield volcano in the Gregory Rift contains a small 1.5-km-wide summit caldera. Eruption of large volumes of trachytic pyroclastic rocks around the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene formed a NW-trending ridge of pyroclastic cones across the summit region; collapse of this area formed the summit caldera and associated craters. A second large crater SE of the caldera is 0.5 x 1 km wide and contains a pumice cone. The summit caldera is narrowly breached on the north side, which has funneled post-caldera lava flows in this direction. The three youngest post-caldera pyroclastic cones on the NE flank may be only a few hundred years old. A series of viscous trachytic lava flows were erupted from vents on the volcano's lower flanks. Young fissure-fed basalts were also erupted to the south, between Paka and Korosi volcanoes. Surficial geothermal activity is widespread at Paka both within the summit caldera and on extensive portions of the northern flank."
"Korosi","36.120,0.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100037.jpg","","The trachytic Korosi shield volcano lies at the north end of Lake Baringo. Unlike other rift valley volcanoes, it does not contain a summit caldera. Lava domes on the northern flanks have fed trachytic lava flows. The major stage of Korosi volcanism spanned a period between 0.4 and 0.1 million years ago and included the eruption of voluminous fluid basaltic lava flows and pyroclastic cone formation along a NNE-trending fissure cutting across the axis of the shield volcano. This was followed by the eruption of trachytic lava domes and pumice/scoria cones. The youngest activity, consisting of fissure-fed basaltic lava flows on the lower northern flanks between Korosi and Paka, was probably coeval with the latest eruptions on Ol Kokwe to the south, which are only a few hundred to a few thousand years old (Dunkley et al. 1993). Fumaroles and hot steaming ground occur around the summit cones and NW flanks over an area of 30 sq km."
"Ol Kokwe","36.075,0.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100036.jpg","","The elongated Ol Kokwe Island in the center of Lake Baringo SW of Korosi volcano consists of young basaltic scoria cones that cap a trachytic shield volcano. The volcano is the smallest in the northern part of the Kenya rift valley. N-S-trending faults cut the complex, producing west-facing scarps. Smaller islands to the north and south are faulted basaltic lava flows; Parmalok Island to the SW is a breached trachytic tuff cone that fed a small lava flow. The latest eruptive activity at Ol Kokwe was estimated to have occurred within the past thousand years (Smith 1991, pers. comm.). Hot springs, boiling mud pools, and fumaroles are present along the faults on the NE peninsula of the island and are frequently visited by tourists."
"Nyambeni Hills","37.870,0.230","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112019.jpg","","The broad NE-SW-trending Nyambeni shield volcano is capped by numerous phonolitic cumulodomes and basaltic cones and lava flows of late-Pleistocene to Holocene age (Hackman et al., 1989). The basaltic cinder cones are the youngest features of Nyambeni Hills volcano. They are clustered in a NE-trending belt along the crest of the shield, in a N-S-trending area including the Mula Hills, and in the Giaki area."
"Menengai","36.070,-0.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111057.jpg","","The massive Menengai shield volcano occupies the floor of the East African Rift. Construction of a 30 cu km shield volcano beginning about 200,000 years ago was followed by the eruption of two voluminous ash-flow tuffs, each preceded by major pumice falls. The first took place about 29,000 years ago and produced a large caldera. The second, producing about 30 cu km of compositionally zoned peralkaline trachytic magma about 8000 years ago, was associated with formation of the present-day 12 x 8 km summit caldera. More than 70 post-caldera lava flows cover the caldera floor, the youngest of which may be only a few hundred years old. No historical eruptions are known. Fumarolic activity is restricted to the caldera."
"Elmenteita Badlands","36.270,-0.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111058.jpg","","The Elmenteita Badlands, located between Lake Elmenteita and Eburru volcano, is an area of pyroclastic cones and lava flows of varying ages. Large basaltic lava flows and basaltic ash cones of Holocene age post-date the 10,000-year-old high-stand of Lake Elmenteita (Thomson and Dodson, 1963)."
"Homa Mountain","34.500,-0.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094071.jpg","","Homa Mountain is a large carbonatitic complex that forms a broad peninsula on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria. The 1751-m-high flat-topped summit of the volcano rises about 600 m above the lake. This dominantly Miocene-to-Pleistocene volcanic complex contains numerous flank vents, including the carbonatitic and ultramafic Lake Simbi maar on the lower east flank. The Chiewo, Got Ojawa, and Got Oloo vents on the southern and western sides of Homa Mountain were formed during the latest stage of carbonatitic activity. Legends of inhabitants near the Lake Simbi maar suggest that it may have been formed in historical time."
"Eburru, Ol Doinyo","36.220,-0.650","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111059.jpg","","Eburru volcano is elongated perpendicular to the Gregory Rift NW of Lake Naivasha. The 2856-m-high, E-W-trending main edifice is eroded, but young partly vegetated rhyolitic domes occur on the east flank and are probably of Holocene age (Thompson and Dodson, 1963). Pleistocene phonolitic and trachytic lava flows are overlain by rhyolitic obsidian lava flows forming much of the northern and NE slopes of the main massif. A prominent late-Pleistocene rhyolitic lava flow from a SE-flank vents extends almost to Lake Naivasha. Extensive fumarolic activity occurs at cinder cones and craters constructed along dominantly N-S-trending faults cutting the massif."
"Olkaria","36.292,-0.904","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111060.jpg","","The Olkaria volcanic complex, located immediately south of Lake Naivasha and west of Longonot volcano, comprises up to 80 individual commenditic and other peralkaline rhyolitic centers. A thick, geochemically diverse basal complex is overlain by a dominantly silicic lava-dome and lava-flow complex constructed within a largely obscurred 11 x 7.5 km wide caldera that formed about 20,000 years ago following the eruption of welded pantelleritic ignimbrites. The youngest known eruption originated from the Ololbutot fissue on the SW side of the complex and produced a 5 cu km lava flow and a pumice flow that has a radiocarbon age of about 180 years. Fumarolic activity occurring at the Njorowa Gorge and at the Orengingnai and Olkaria (Orgaria) pumice cones, and Olkaria is the site of a large 50-80 sq km high-temperature geothermal field."
"Longonot","36.446,-0.914","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094011.jpg","","The trachytic Longonot stratovolcano SE of Lake Naivasha in the Gregory Rift valley contains a 8 x 12 km caldera. Formation of the caldera accompanied large explosive eruptions about 21,000 years ago. A large central cone that was constructed within the caldera forms the 2776-m-high summit of the volcano. The younger cone is truncated by a circular, 1.8-km-wide crater. Post-caldera lavas are found on the caldera floor and the volcano's flanks, marking a late stage of effusive eruptions. A well-preserved satellitic cone is located on the NE flank. Masai tradition records a lava flow on the northern flank during the 19th century. Similarly youthful-looking lava flows occur on the SW flank."
"Suswa","36.350,-1.175","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114076.jpg","","The southernmost caldera of the Kenya rift, Suswa contains a prominent lava cone on the south side of its 8 x 12 km caldera. Suswa lies south of Longonot volcano and about 50 km WNW of the capital city of Nairobi. Construction of an early shield volcano was followed by eruption of voluminous Pleistocene pumice and lava flows that accompanied incremental formation of the caldera. The 2356-m summit of the phonolitic-to-trachytic volcano is formed by the post-caldera lava cone of Ol Doinyo Onyoke ('The Red Mountain,' also known as Ol Doinyo Nyukie) on the south side of the caldera. Its large elongated summit crater is truncated on the north by a ring graben. This unusual 5-km-wide circular graben at the center of the older caldera isolates a tilted island block of caldera-floor lava flows. The latest eruptions have originated from satellitic vents that issued lava flows which remain unvegetated and may be only a century or so old."
"Lengai, Ol Doinyo","35.914,-2.764","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/001095.jpg","","The symmetrical Ol Doinyo Lengai is the only volcano known to have erupted carbonatite tephras and lavas in historical time. The prominent stratovolcano, known to the Maasai as 'The Mountain of God,' rises abruptly above the broad plain south of Lake Natron in the Gregory Rift Valley. The cone-building stage ended about 15,000 years ago and was followed by periodic ejection of natrocarbonatitic and nephelinite tephra during the Holocene. Historical eruptions have consisted of smaller tephra ejections and emission of numerous natrocarbonatitic lava flows on the floor of the summit crater and occasionally down the upper flanks. The depth and morphology of the northern crater have changed dramatically during the course of historical eruptions, ranging from steep crater walls about 200 m deep in the mid-20th century to shallow platforms mostly filling the crater. Long-term lava effusion in the summit crater beginning in 1983 had by the turn of the century mostly filled the northern crater; by late 1998 lava had begun overflowing the crater rim."
"Chyulu Hills","37.880,-2.680","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111054.jpg","","The 100-km-long NW-SE-trending Chyulu Hills volcanic field is located 150 km E of the Kenya Rift. It contains several hundred small cones and flows, including numerous recent cinder cones. Two of these, Shaitani and Chainu, erupted during the mid-19th century. Volcanic activity began about 1.4 million years ago with eruptions in the northern Chyulu Hills and migrated to the SE, where a large number of Holocene cones are found. Many of the cinder cones are aligned along dominantly NW-trending older faults and younger NNE-trending fissures. The silica contents of the lava flows increased with time. Early flows consisted of foidites; later Holocene lava flows are basanites and alkali basalts."
"Kilimanjaro","37.350,-3.070","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094014.jpg","","Massive Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, consists of three large stratovolcanoes constructed along a NW-SE trend. The ice-capped, 5895-m-high summit towers 5200 m above the surrounding plains. Activity at the older cone, Shira, that forms the broad WNW shoulder began during the Pliocene, and the extensively dissected Pleistocene Mawenzi forms a prominent, sharp-topped peak on the upper ESE flank dominated by a densely packed radial dike swarm. More than 250 satellitic cones occupy a rift zone to the NW and SE of Kibo, the central stratovolcano. A 2.4 x 3.6 km caldera gives the summit of Kibo an elongated, broad profile. Most of Kilimanjaro was constructed during the Pleistocene, but a group of youthful-looking nested summit craters are of apparent Holocene age, and fumarolic activity continues."
"Igwisi Hills","31.930,-4.891","Three kimberlitic pyroclastic cones of late Pleistocene or Holocene age are located in the Igwisi Hills, WNW of the city of Tabora in NW Tanzania. The volcanoes were erupted along a NE-SW-trending rift through a precambrian granitic gneiss basement and are located on the western side of the Tanzanian Craton far from other Tanzanian volcanoes, which are located near the Gregory Rift. Two pyroclastic cones with well-preserved craters rising 15 to 45 m above the plain occur at Igwisi, with a central cone and crater adjacent to the NE crater that contains a solidified lava lake. The NE crater is the largest, 370 m in diameter, and has been breached on the ENE side, the source of a small lava flow about 1 km in length and width. The SW crater is also breached on the ENE side, with a smaller lava flow on the east flank. Cosmogenic Helium ages for the Igwisi Hills eruption with wide uncertainties range from late Pleistocene to mid Holocene."
"Unnamed","33.583,-8.624","A small unnamed basaltic tephra cone on the edge of the Usangu escarpment, overlooking the Usangu basin north of the Poroto Mountains, was considered by Ebinger et al.

Numerous pyroclastic cones are situated along the ridge. Eruption of the Kitulo Pumice, radiocarbon dated at about 10,200 cal. years before present, is though to be related to formation of the caldera. The youngest activity appears to have originated from the caldera and from youthful-looking pyroclastic cones to the north; the youngest known eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that swept at least 10 km S about 500 years ago."
"Izumbwe-Mpoli","33.380,-8.976","Two melanephelinite cones of probable Holocene age, Izumbwe and Mpoli, are located ~18 km WNW of Ngozi caldera and just NW of Izumbwe village.

Hummocky terrain from a debris-avalanche deposit produced by collapse of the summit and western flank extends at least 20 km SW of the volcano. The trachytic caldera is largely filled by a series of youthful-looking uneroded and sparsely vegetated pumice cones, lava domes, and explosion craters. The latter are also found on the southern and northern flanks. A large area of basaltic cones and lava flows are found on the NW flank, and youthful-looking lava flows extend SW from vents inside the caldera. Explosive and effusive eruptions were produced during the Holocene; the largest explosive eruption took place about 4000 years ago, and the most recent about about 1200 years ago."
"Meru","36.750,-3.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094020.jpg","","Meru volcano, Africa's fourth highest mountain, is dwarfed by neighboring Kilimanjaro volcano, but is an impressive peak in its own right. Seen from the west, Meru has a conical profile, but it contains a 5-km-wide breached caldera on the east side that formed about 7800 years ago when the summit of the volcano collapsed. Associated massive debris avalanches and lahars traveled as far as the western flank of Kilimanjaro volcano. Parasitic cones and lava domes are located on all sides; a maar field is present on the lower north flank. The historically active Ash Cone forms a prominent symmetrical cone inside the breached caldera. A second vent between it and the caldera headwall has fed lava flows that cover much of the caldera floor."

This stratovolcano, rising to 2175 m, is elongated in a NW-SE direction and has been active since the mid-Pleistocene. Maars, some of which contain lakes, surround the Kyejo area, and young basaltic cinder cones and lava flows cover an extensive area to the south. The latest eruption around 1800 CE took place from two parasitic tephritic cones, Sarabwe and Fiteko, that were constructed along a NW-trending fissure. The eruption produced lava flows that traveled 8 km and overran several villages."

The volcanic field, straddling the equator, covers an area of about 180 sq km and contains a group of about 80 foiditic tuff cones and maars, some of which are filled by lakes. Lake Katwe is a shallow 3-km-long body of water that occupies two of three intersecting craters immediately NE of Lake Edward. Local folk tales suggest that volcanism in the Katwe-Kikorongo area has continued into historical times."
"Bunyaruguru","30.080,-0.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114094.jpg","","The late-Plestocene to Holocene Bunyaruguru volcanic field, also known as the Kichwambe volcanic field, straddles the equator along the eastern side of the Western Rift Valley, south of Lake George. The Bunyaruguru volcanic field contains more than 130 maars, 27 of which contain lakes with water ranging from fresh to saline. Friable calcareous volcanic tuffs are inter-bedded with Pleistocene and Recent sediments. Only a few foiditic lava flows are found in the volcanic field. Although no dated eruptions are known, Reece (1955) noted that volcanic activity probably continued into historical times."
"Katunga","30.191,-0.471","Katunga, an isolated tuff cone with associated lava flows located east of Lake Edward, is the southernmost feature of a N-S-trending chain of high-potassium foditic volcanic fields in the Western Rift Valley of Uganda. Katunga is the type locality of the rock type katungite, an olivine-melilitite. The undissected tuff cone was erupted through metamorphic basement rocks and its rim and flanks are blanketed with ejected schists. Katunga contains a freshwater lake in its summit crater. Two lava flows traveled to the NE from vents on the north and NE flanks. The age of the cone is uncertain, but it is contemporaneous with late-Pleistocene to Recent tuff cones in the Bunyaruguru area, and the undissected condition of the tuff cone and associated lava flows implies a young age."
"Nyamuragira","29.200,-1.408","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109084.jpg","","Africa's most active volcano, Nyamuragira, is a massive high-potassium basaltic shield about 25 km north of Lake Kivu. Also known as Nyamulagira, it has a volume of 500 cu km, and extensive lava flows blanket 1500 sq km of the western branch of the East African Rift. The broad low-angle shield volcano contrasts dramatically with its steep-sided neighbor Nyiragongo to the SW. The 3058-m-high summit is truncated by a small 2 x 2.3 km caldera that has walls up to about 100 m high. Historical eruptions have occurred within the summit caldera, as well as from the numerous fissures and cinder cones on the flanks. A lava lake in the summit crater, active since at least 1921, drained in 1938, at the time of a major flank eruption. Historical lava flows extend down the flanks more than 30 km from the summit, reaching as far as Lake Kivu."
"Nyiragongo","29.250,-1.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/058064.jpg","","One of Africa's most notable volcanoes, Nyiragongo contained a lava lake in its deep summit crater that was active for half a century before draining catastrophically through its outer flanks in 1977. In contrast to the low profile of its neighboring shield volcano, Nyamuragira, 3470-m-high Nyiragongo displays the steep slopes of a stratovolcano. Benches in the steep-walled, 1.2-km-wide summit crater mark levels of former lava lakes, which have been observed since the late-19th century. Two older stratovolcanoes, Baruta and Shaheru, are partially overlapped by Nyiragongo on the north and south. About 100 parasitic cones are located primarily along radial fissures south of Shaheru, east of the summit, and along a NE-SW zone extending as far as Lake Kivu. Many cones are buried by voluminous lava flows that extend long distances down the flanks, which is characterized by the eruption of foiditic rocks. The extremely fluid 1977 lava flows caused many fatalities, as did lava flows that inundated portions of the major city of Goma in January 2002."
"Karisimbi","29.450,-1.506","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111089.jpg","","Karisimbi, the highest of the Virunga volcanoes, is a complex volcano with a symmetrical sharp-peaked summit. The 2-km-wide Branca caldera, located SE of the ~4500-m-high summit, is filled by viscous lava flows and two explosion craters. The large, 1.2-km-wide Muntango pit crater is located south of the summit of the basanitic-to-trachytic volcano. A broad lava plain, formed from lava flows erupted within the caldera and along a chain of parasitic cones, extends SW. More than 100 parasitic cones erupted along a NNE-SSW zone that extends to the shores of Lake Kivu. The youngest Potassium-Argon date obtained is about 10,000 years before present (de Mulder, 1985). The youngest eruptions produced a group of dome-shaped parasitic vents east of the caldera, which fed viscous lava flows that traveled as far as 12 km E, and lava flows from the SW-flank satellitic lava vents."

The cinder cones occur in clusters and were erupted along lineaments. They are typically breached on one side by lava flows. Their age is not known precisely, but they are considered younger than the stratovolcanoes of the Virunga Range, some of which are Holocene in age. The Bufumbira rocks are noted for their unusual ultrapotassic chemistry."
"Tshibinda","28.750,-2.320","The Tshibinda volcanic field, located west of the SW end of Lake Kivu near the Congo-Rwanda border, consists of a group of three basaltic cinder cones and associated lava flows. Their age is not known precisely, but they may have been active within the past 2000 years."
"Sao Tome","6.580,0.200","Sao Tome is a roughly conical island in the Gulf of Guinea that rises to a height of 2024 m from a depth of 3000 m below sea level. The southern and western parts of the island are more dissected, and dramatic phonolitic and trachytic spines rise vertically out of the rain forest. Most of the lavas erupted over the last million years are basaltic in composition. The youngest dated volcanic rock on Sao Tome is 0.1 million years old. However, the Sao Tome shield volcano is dotted with numerous morphologically recent cinder cones, many of which are concentrated on the SE side of the island."

"Tombel Graben","9.670,4.750","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111035.jpg","","Young cinder cones and maars dot the low-lying Tombel Graben (also referred to as the Tombel Plain) between Mount Cameroon and Mount Manengouba. Activity in the 10-20 km wide graben began with the emission of large lava flows over a basement of Precambrian metamorphic rocks and Cretaceous sandstones and concluded with explosive activity forming numerous cinder cones. The 800 sq km Tombel Graben volcanic field erupted basanitic, basaltic, and trachybasaltic rocks and contains three large lake-filled maars, including Barombi Mbo, a compound maar near the town of Kumba. Legends record an eruption of Le Djungo (also known as Mont Pelé) that destroyed a village, consistent with its youthful, unvegetated morphology."
"Cameroon","9.170,4.203","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/086085.jpg","","Mount Cameroon, one of Africa's largest volcanoes, rises to 4095 m above the coast of west Cameroon. The massive steep-sided volcano of dominantly basaltic-to-trachybasaltic composition forms a volcanic horst constructed above a basement of Precambrian metamorphic rocks covered with Cretaceous to Quaternary sediments. More than 100 small cinder cones, often fissure-controlled parallel to the long axis of the massive 1400 cu km volcano, occur on the flanks and surrounding lowlands. A large satellitic peak, Etinde (also known as Little Cameroon), is located on the southern flank near the coast. Historical activity, the most frequent of west African volcanoes, was first observed in the 5th century BCE by the Carthaginian navigator Hannon. During historical time, moderate explosive and effusive eruptions have occurred from both summit and flank vents. A 1922 SW-flank eruption produced a lava flow that reached the Atlantic coast, and a lava flow from a 1999 south-flank eruption stopped only 200 m from the sea."
"Oku Volcanic Field","10.500,6.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/002064.jpg","","Numerous maars and basaltic cinder cones lie on or near the deeply dissected rhyolitic and trachytic Mount Oku massif along the Cameroon volcanic line. The Mount Oku stratovolcano is cut by a large caldera. The Oku volcanic field is noted for two crater lakes, Lake Nyos to the north and Lake Monoun to the south, that recently produced catastrophic carbon-dioxide gas release events. The August 15, 1984, gas release at Lake Monoun was attributed to overturn of stratified lake water, triggered by an earthquake and landslide. The Lake Nyos event on August 21, 1986, caused at least 1700 fatalities. The emission of around 1 cu km of magmatic carbon dioxide has been attributed either to overturn of stratified lake waters as a result of a non-volcanic process, or to phreatic explosions or injection of hot gas into the lake."
"Ngaoundere Plateau","13.670,7.250","The Ngaoundere volcanic field is located within a larger late-Miocene region of plateau basalts, plug domes and a single large basanitic-to-trachytic stratovolcano, Nganha. Quaternary volcanism is situated east of Ngaoundere and Wakwa, and consists of scoria cones and lava flows, maars, and tuff cones. A single Potassium-Argon date of 0.9 million years ago has been obtained from a lava flow east of Wakwa, although some volcanoes are possibly of Holocene age (Vincent 1992, pers. comm.). The most recent eruptive activity originated from a chain of cinder cones aligned in a WNW-ESE direction."
"Biu Plateau","12.000,10.750","The Biu Plateau in NE Nigeria is composed of basaltic lava flows. A large number of recent cinder cones with well-defined craters are aligned in a NNW-SSE direction.

Activity began with the eruption of about 30 trachytic and phonolitic volcanoes through Precambrian basement rocks. This was followed by the formation of about 130 basaltic cones that typically produced a valley filling lava flow. A series of NW-SE-trending faults control volcano locations. The date of the latest eruption of the Todra volcanic field is not known, but may have been as recent as a few centuries ago."
"Tin Zaouatene Volcanic Field","2.830,19.830","A small volcanic field in the Tin Zaouatene area of Iforas province in eastern Mali, near the border with Algeria and Niger, was assigned a Holocene age (Liegeois et al., 2005).

"Tahalra Volcanic Field","5.000,22.670","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119026.jpg","","The elongated, E-W-trending Tahalra volcanic field covers an area of about 1800 sq km in the Hoggar Province of southern Algeria. The large volcanic field lies WSW of the town of Tamanrasset and was active from the Miocene to the Holocene, producing alkaline strombolian cones and lava flows. The high point of the volcanic field, which was constructed over a basement of Precambrian metamorphic and plutonic rocks of the Tuareg shield, lies near its eastern end. A dozen trachytic-to-rhyolitic lava domes and spines formed during the Pliocene, and Pliocene-to Pleistocene activity formed about 100 small strombolian basaltic (mostly basanitic) cones. The most recent activity during the Pleistocene and Holocene produced about 20 maars and cones along the northern margin of the volcanic field."

The latest stage of activity began around 1.95 million years and continued almost to the present. Lava flows cover Holocene lake sediments dated at about 10,000 year Before Present (BP) and alluvial terraces in which Neolithic artifacts have been found. Historical pottery has been found within lava flows in the Tahifet area, and oral traditions of the Tuareg people also suggest that eruptions were witnessed. Sporadic fumaroles and persistent small-scale seismicity has been noted during historical time."

A 4-km-wide, 100-m-deep caldera contains a post-caldera scoria cone, Wau-en-Namus. An apron of dark basaltic tephra extends 10-20 km around the caldera in stark contrast to the light-colored desert sand prominent in satellite views. Three small salt lakes of variable color contribute to the name of the volcano, which means 'Oasis of Mosquitoes.' The youthful appearance of the central cone has suggested it may be as young as a few thousand years, although the arid climate may mask its actual age. Yellow sulfur deposits are found in the 150-m-wide crater. Other basaltic lava flows occur several tens of km NW of the volcano."

More than 90 eruptive centers along a WNW-ESE line were constructed over Precambrian and Paleozoic granitic rocks near the center of the Bayuda Desert. Most vents are cinder cones that produced lava flows which breached the cones. About 10% of vents in the field are explosion craters, the largest of which, named Hosh ed Dalam, is 1.3 km wide and up to 500 m deep. The youngest basalts appear to post-date the last period of moist climate in Sudan, which ended as recently as about 5000 years ago. One of the least eroded lava flows was dated at about 1100 years ago."

"Damavand","52.109,35.951","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119095.jpg","","Damavand volcano towers dramatically 70 km to the NE above Iran's capital city of Tehran and 70 km south of the Caspian Sea. The 5670-m-high stratovolcano is the highest volcano in the Middle East. A younger cone has been constructed during the past 600,000 years over an older edifice, remnants of which were previously interpreted as a caldera wall. Flank vents are rare, and activity at the dominantly trachyandesite volcano has been concentrated at the summit vent, which has produced a series of radial lava flows. Lava effusion has dominated at Damavand; pyroclastic activity has been limited and the only major explosive event produced a welded ignimbrite about 280,000 years ago. The youngest activity has consisted of the eruption of a series of lava flows from the summit vent that cover the western side of the volcano. The youngest dated lava flows were emplaced about 7000 years ago. No historical eruptions are known from Damavand, but hot springs are located on the volcano's flanks, and fumaroles are found at the summit crater."

The olivine basaltic volcanic field of Harrat ar Raha lies south of the Plain of El-'Hisma, south of the town of Tabuk. There are fewer young volcanoes in Harrat ar Rahah than in other harrats (lava fields) to the south. Harrat ar Rahah is erosionally divided into two segments and is about 35 km wide at its broadest extent on the west, narrowing down to less than a kilometer in width at the divide at Matar. Lava flows are more numerous in the southern segment, where they rise up to 550 m above the Cambrian sandstone plain. On the southern and SW sides the sandstones and the basaltic lava fields are dissected, and lava flows traveled mainly to the NE. Neumann van Padang (1963) in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World speculated that the Israelite account in Exodus 19:16-18 might refer to an eruption from Harrat ar Rahah."

It contains about 50 volcanic cones that were constructed over Precambrian crystalline rocks along a N-S axis. Harrat Lunayyir is one of the smallest of the Holocene lava fields of Saudi Arabia, but individual flow lobes radiate long distances from the center of the Harrat, and flows reached the Red Sea in two places. Lava flows are basaltic to basanitic in composition, and the Holocene flows are alkali olivine basalts. One of the cones may have erupted around the 10th century CE or earlier. A seismic swarm in May 2009 was interpreted to be consistent with intrusion of an 8-km-long dike to shallow crustal levels."

Vents form a general N-S pattern, but are more scattered than those of Harrat Khaybar. Harrat Ithnayn rocks are of basaltic and basanitic composition and lack the silicic components present in neighboring Harrat Khaybar. The youngest lava flows from Harrat Ithnayn are less than 4500 years old. An uncertain report of an historical eruption in 1800 CE is considered unlikely by Camp et al.

Most of Harrat Kishb is of Pleistocene age; Holocene flows are restricted to three areas in the western half of the field. Jabal Aslaj cone and its associated lava flows contain abundant granitic blocks from basement rocks and ultramafic nodules. Jabal Hil is a large scoria cone with a 300-m-wide crater that was filled and overtopped by a lava lake. Harrat Kishb includes several tuff rings and maars, including the 800 x 600 m wide Al Wabah maar in the west-central part of the Harrat. The most recent products of Harrat Kishb, which include the scoria cones and lava flows of Jabal Aslaj and Jabal Hil and the Jabal Shalman lava-dome, lava-flow, and scoria-cone complex, are stratigraphically younger than a pluvial period dated about 6500-4000 years before present."

Basaltic scoria cones dominate Harrat Rahat, but the volcanic field has also produced more silicic trachy-basaltic to trachytic rocks. Small shield volcanoes and pelean-type lava domes with associated pyroclastic-flow and -surge deposits are also present. Activity has migrated to the north, resulting in eruptions in historical time near Madinah.

Elongated rift zones extend to the NNW and SE from the summit of the Hawaiian-style basaltic shield, which has an asymmetrical profile that is steeper to the south. The lower SE rift zone forms the Massif du Badjini, a peninsula at the SE tip of the island. Historical eruptions have modified the morphology of the compound, irregular summit caldera. More than twenty eruptions have been recorded since the 19th century from both summit and flank vents. Many lava flows have reached the sea on both sides of the island, including during many 19th-century eruptions from the summit caldera and vents on the northern and southern flanks.

Much of its more than 530,000-year history overlapped with eruptions of the deeply dissected Piton des Neiges shield volcano to the NW. Three calderas formed at about 250,000, 65,000, and less than 5000 years ago by progressive eastward slumping of the volcano. Numerous pyroclastic cones dot the floor of the calderas and their outer flanks. Most historical eruptions have originated from the summit and flanks of Dolomieu, a 400-m-high lava shield that has grown within the youngest caldera, which is 8 km wide and breached to below sea level on the eastern side. More than 150 eruptions, most of which have produced fluid basaltic lava flows, have occurred since the 17th century. Only six eruptions, in 1708, 1774, 1776, 1800, 1977, and 1986, have originated from fissures on the outer flanks of the caldera.

"Boomerang Seamount","77.825,-37.721","An active submarine volcano 18 km NE of Amsterdam Island was first discovered during a bathymetric survey in 1996. The volcano, named Boomerang Seamount, rises to within 650 m of the sea surface and has a 2-km-wide summit caldera that is 200 m deep. Rift zones extend SE and north of the basaltic volcano, giving it an arcuate shape. Boomerang Seamount lies along the axis of the Southeast Indian Ridge and marks the site of the Amsterdam-St. Paul hotspot. This hotspot may have been the source of the Ninetyeast Ridge submarine volcanoes on the Australian Plate prior to its 'capture' by the Southeast Indian Ridge, after which volcanism was restricted to the Antarctic Plate. Very short half-life radionuclide dating of fresh volcanic glass samples recovered during the 1996 expedition indicated that Boomerang Seamount had erupted only about 5 months earlier (Johnson et al., 2000). Water column temperature anomalies above the seamount suggest the presence of hydrothermal activity within the caldera."

The basaltic volcano is located near the axis of the East Indian Ocean Ridge adjacent to the Indian Plate. Amsterdam volcano was formed during two episodes of cone growth accompanied by the formation of small calderas. The caldera of the youngest eruptive center, 2 km ENE of the earlier one, contained a lava lake that fed several stages of lava outflows. Minor late-stage eruptions formed more than two dozen scoria cones and many small lava flows. No historical eruptions are known, although the fresh morphology of the latest volcanism at Dumas Crater on the NE flank suggests it may have occurred as recently as a century ago (Nougier, 1982)."

St. Paul is composed of a older tuff cone surmounted by a basaltic stratovolcano with a 1.8-km-wide caldera. The entire NE half of the volcano was submerged following collapse along a NW-trending fault. This breached the central caldera, leaving an 80-m-deep bay connected to the ocean by a narrow channel only a few meters deep. Geothermal areas are located near the 268-m-high caldera rim and along the margins of the caldera bay. The only recorded historical eruption took place in 1793 from a vent on the lower SW flank."

The largest island, McDonald, is composed of a layered phonolitic tuff plateau cut by phonolitic dikes and lava domes. A possible nearby active submarine center was inferred from phonolitic pumice that washed up on Heard Island in 1992. Volcanic plumes were observed in December 1996 and January 1997 from McDonald Island. During March of 1997 the crew of a vessel that sailed near the island noted vigorous steaming from a vent at the northern side of the island along with possible pyroclastic deposits and lava flows. A satellite image taken in November 2001 showed the island to have more than doubled in area since previous reported observations in November 2000. The high point of the island group had shifted to the northern end of McDonald Island, which had merged with Flat Island."
"Heard","73.513,-53.106","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/003030.jpg","","Heard Island on the Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean consists primarily of the emergent portion of two volcanic structures. The large glacier-covered composite basaltic-to-trachytic cone of Big Ben comprises most of the island, and the smaller Mt. Dixon volcano lies at the NW tip of the island across a narrow isthmus. Little is known about the structure of Big Ben volcano because of its extensive ice cover. The historically active Mawson Peak forms the island's 2745-m high point and lies within a 5-6 km wide caldera breached to the SW side of Big Ben. Small satellitic scoria cones are mostly located on the northern coast. Several subglacial eruptions have been reported in historical time at this isolated volcano, but observations are infrequent and additional activity may have occurred."
"Kerguelen Islands","69.500,-49.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104022.jpg","","The Kerguelen Islands are composed primarily of Tertiary flood basalts and a complex of plutonic rocks.

The Rallier du Baty Peninsula on the SW tip of the island contains two youthful subglacial eruptive centers, Mont St. Allouarn and Mont Henri Rallier du Baty. An active fumarole field is related to a series of Holocene trachytic lava flows and lahars that extend beyond the icecap (Ballestracci and Nougier, 1984). Gagnevin et al. (2003) dated a trachytic ignimbrite that was considered to represent the last major eruptive event on the Kerguelen Archipelago at 26,000 +/- 3000 years."
"Est, Ile de l'","52.200,-46.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112006.jpg","","Ile de l'Est, the easternmost island in the Crozet archipelago, is a glacially eroded basaltic stratovolcano with scoria cones concentrated on its eastern flank.

The 10 x 19 km wide Ile de l'Est is the oldest of the Crozet Islands, but contains five younger oxidized scoria cones, most of which are on the eastern side of the island. The young scoria cones may be Holocene in age (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990)."

The structural center of the volcano is located on the western side of the 14 x 19 km wide island, which has an irregular shoreline. The stratovolcano was formed during at least five stages dating back to the Miocene. The eruption of plateau basalts from a rift system during stage IV was followed by a glacial period and then by the eruption of scoria cones and lava flows. The young scoria cones are of probable Holocene age and are distributed over much of the island. They are concentrated at the structural center on the west side and along a series of N-S and NE-trending fractures. The Mont Branca cone on the western flank has been estimated by Bellair (1964) to be not more than a few centuries old."

The production of phreatomagmatic breccias inter-bedded with thin lava flows was followed by block faulting and the eruption of scoria cones and lava flows along four radial fracture systems. Bellair (1964) considered the Morne Rouge cone on the eastern coast to be even younger than an estimated several-hundred-year-old cone on Possession Island."
"Prince Edward Island","37.950,-46.630","Uninhabited 5 x 10 km wide Prince Edward Island lies opposite Marion Island at the northern end of a submarine plateau on the Antarctic Plate immediately south of the SW Indian Ocean Ridge.

The low profile of the 24-km-wide dominantly basaltic and trachybasaltic volcano is formed by two young shields that rise above a flat-topped submarine platform. The 1230-m-high island is dotted by about 150 cinder cones, smaller scoria cones, and coastal tuff cones. The earliest dated eruptions took place about 450,000 years ago, but much of the island is covered by Holocene aa and pahoehoe lava flows, and more than 130 scoria cones formed during the Holocene. Many of these appear younger than the 4020 BP peat layer overlying one of the flows (Verwoerd, 1981). Young unvegetated lava flows appear to be only a few hundred years old (Verwoerd, 1967). The first historical eruption, during 1980, produced explosive activity and lava flows from a 5-km-long fissure that extended from the summit to the west coast."

In addition to the younger dominantly basaltic rocks, Miocene dacitic lava domes and rhyolitic breccias are also present at Whangarei. Quaternary volcanics form a group of large cones SE of Whangarei, a NE-aligned group of scoria cones north of the city, and a group of lava flows east of the city along a major fault. The youngest basalts were mapped as Holocene (Kear and Thompson, 1964), although the age of the field is not well known and there are some indications that the latest eruption may have been during the late Pleistocene, about 30,000 years ago (Latter 1994, pers. comm.)."

A 3-km-wide composite caldera was formed in two or three collapse events, the last of which took place about 6300 years ago, and was accompanied by a plinian eruption that produced tephra deposits up to 70 cm thick on mainland North Island. Post-caldera eruptions generated a series of lava domes and flows emplaced from NNE-trending vents within the caldera that have filled it to depths of at least 180 m. The latest eruption of Mayor Island has not been dated, but was considered by Houghton et al. (1992) to perhaps have occurred only 500-1000 years ago."

More than 50 maars, tuff rings, small lava shields, and scoria cones have formed in the past 140,000 years in an elliptical volcanic field 29 km long in its largest (N-S) direction. The Auckland volcanic field has dominantly produced intraplate alkali basaltic to basantic rocks forming the northernmost of a group of Quaternary volcanic fields of the Auckland Intraplate Province. Of the 19 eruptions known to have occurred within the past 20,000 years, only one eruptive center is known to have been active during the Holocene (Smith and Allen, 1993). The Rangitoto eruption, about 600 years ago, was the largest of the Auckland volcanic field and created the 6-km-wide Rangitoto Island, which consists of multiple scoria cones up to 260-m high that cap a low shield volcano with a broad apron of lava flows."

Volckner Rocks, four sea stacks that are remnants of a lava dome, lie 5 km NNE of White Island. Intermittent moderate phreatomagmatic and strombolian eruptions have occurred at White Island throughout the short historical period beginning in 1826, but its activity also forms a prominent part of Maori legends. Formation of many new vents during the 19th and 20th centuries has produced rapid changes in crater floor topography.

Lava domes of the Haroharo complex, at the northern end of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, occupy part of the 16 x 26 km Pleistocene Haroharo caldera, which formed incrementally between 300,000 and 50,000 years before present (BP). The oldest exposed rocks on the caldera floor are about 22,000 years old. The Tarawera complex at the southern end of Okataina consists of 11 rhyolitic lava domes and associated lava flows. The oldest domes were formed as late as about 15,000 years BP, and the youngest were formed in the Kaharoa eruption about 800 years BP. The NE-SW Tarawera vent lineation extends from the two dacitic cones of Maungaongaonga and Mangakakaramea on the SW to Mount Edgecumbe on the NE. Construction of the Haroharo and Tarawera complexes impounded lakes Rotoiti, Totoehu, Okataina, and Tarawera against the outer margins of the Okataina ring structure.

The Whakamaru caldera partially overlaps with the Taupo caldera on the south and was formed during the eruption of the Whakamaru Group ignimbrites between about 340 and 330 ka. The Maroa caldera was subsequently filled by at least 70 rhyolitic lava domes or flows, mostly erupted along a SW-NE trend. Lesser amounts of basalt were also erupted. The latest dated magmatic eruption took place about 14 ka, when the rhyolitic Puketarata tuff ring and lava domes were formed (Brooker et al., 1993). The Orakeikorako, Ngatamariki, Rotokaua, and Wairakei hydrothermal areas are located within or adjacent to the Whakamaru caldera.

This was the largest known eruption at Taupo, producing about 1170 cu km of tephra. This eruption was preceded during the late Pleistocene by the eruption of a large number of rhyolitic lava domes north of Lake Taupo. Large explosive eruptions have occurred frequently during the Holocene from many vents within Lake Taupo and near its margins. The most recent major eruption took place about 1800 years BP from at least three vents along a NE-SW-trending fissure centered on the Horomotangi Reefs.

A single historically active vent, Crater Lake, is located in the broad summit region, but at least five other vents on the summit and flank have been active during the Holocene. Frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions have occurred in historical time from the Crater Lake vent, and tephra characteristics suggest that the crater lake may have formed as early as 3000 years ago.

The pre-caldera Macauley volcano consisted of two generations of shield volcanoes separated by a period of growth of a pyroclastic cone. Eruption of the voluminous Sandy Bay Tuff about 6300 years ago truncated the NW side of the Annexation shield volcano and formed a 12-km-wide, 1.1-km deep caldera during one of the largest eruptions identified in the SW Pacific. Following formation of the caldera and substantial marine erosion, a partly submarine and partly subaerial eruption centered about 2 km north of present-day Macauley Island produced basaltic scoriae and lava flows. A reported possible eruption from 'Brimstone Island,' 45 km west of Macauley at a location with a depth of about 2000 m and SW of Giggenbach submarine volcano, is likely a location error and could refer to an eruption from the submarine flank of Macauley caldera (Lloyd et al., 1996)."

Much of the edifice is blanketed by dacitic pumice, and several edifice-collapse scarps cut its flanks. Large satellite cones are found on the ENE and SSW flanks, and a chain of eight small satellitic cones that fed recent andesitic-dacitic lava flows lies on the west flank. A large hydrothermal vent field was found within the summit crater."

During the past several thousand years volcanism has been dominated by dacitic explosive eruptions. Two Holocene calderas are found at Raoul. The older caldera cuts the center of Raoul Island and is about 2.5 x 3.5 km wide. Denham caldera, formed during a major dacitic explosive eruption about 2200 years ago, truncated the western side of the island and is 6.5 x 4 km wide. Its long axis is parallel to the tectonic fabric of the Havre Trough that lies west of the volcanic arc. Historical eruptions at Raoul during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera. A 240-m-high unnamed submarine cone, one of several located along a fissure on the lower NNE flank of Raoul volcano, has also erupted during historical time, and satellitic vents at Raoul are concentrated along two parallel NNE-trending lineaments."
"Havre Seamount","-179.033,-31.080","Havre Seamount has a caldera capping a 1-km-high edifice. Located on the Kermadec ridge of the Kermadec microplate, it is believed to have erupted in July 2012, the first historical evidence of activity. The caldera has an asymmetric morphology with the N rim comprising mostly a single inner topographic wall, and the S rim comprising both an outer topographic rim and inner wall separated by a 1.1-1.4-km-wide terrace. Smaller craters occur on this terrace. Rocks from the caldera wall include aphyric and plagioclase-bearing basalt-andesite, aphyric and plagioclase- and pyroxene-bearing dacite, gabbro, diorite, and pumice (Wright et al., 2006)."
"Monowai","-177.188,-25.887","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116089.jpg","","Monowai, also known as Orion seamount, rises to within 100 m of the sea surface about halfway between the Kermadec and Tonga island groups. The volcano lies at the southern end of the Tonga Ridge and is slightly offset from the Kermadec volcanoes. Small parasitic cones occur on the N and W flanks of the basaltic submarine volcano, which rises from a depth of about 1500 m and was named for one of the New Zealand Navy bathymetric survey ships that documented its morphology. A large 8.5 x 11 km wide submarine caldera with a depth of more than 1500 m lies to the NNE. Numerous eruptions from Monowai have been detected from submarine acoustic signals since it was first recognized as a volcano in 1977. A shoal that had been reported in 1944 may have been a pumice raft or water disturbance due to degassing. Surface observations have included water discoloration, vigorous gas bubbling, and areas of upwelling water, sometimes accompanied by rumbling noises."
"Unnamed","-177.020,-24.800","A large submarine volcano located at the southern end of the Tonga arc rises to within 385 m of the sea surface. Known informally as Volcano 19, the basaltic to basaltic-andesite seamount contains two calderas, a 3.5 x 2.5 km wide outer caldera and a 1.9-km-wide inner caldera on the west side of the volcano. A central cone complex lies in the center of the outer caldera, east of the inner caldera. Two large hydrothermal fields are located near the summit of the central cone complex and at the base of the southern wall of the western inner caldera. Large high-temperature chimney vents discharge clear fluids and black smoke."
"Unnamed","-175.750,-21.150","A large submarine volcano rises to within 65 m of the sea surface west of Tongatapu Island. The volcano was informally named Volcano #1 by the scientists on the bathymetric survey that discovered the submarine volcano in 2003. The summit of the andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is cut by a large 7 x 4.5 km wide caldera, with two young scoria cones forming the high point of the seamount. A chain of explosion craters up to 100 m deep cut the flank of one of the scoria cones, and thick deposits of ash and scoria blanket the caldera floor nearby. The lack of organic sediments between volcaniclastic deposits exposed in one portion of the caldera wall suggest it was constructed within the past 200 years. Diffuse low-temperature hydrothermal vents and vigorous gas discharge occurs near the explosion craters."
"Unnamed","-175.650,-21.380","During an eruption in 1907 from an unnamed submarine volcano pyroclastic material was ejected to 100 m above the sea surface, and pumice rafts were produced. The eruption was approximately located (on Admiralty Chart 2421) at a point 48 km SW of Tongatapu Island, along the Tofua volcanic arc. Tongatapu is located at the southern end of a chain of coral islands paralleling the Tofua volcanic arc on its eastern side. The reported location of the 1907 eruption corresponds to sloping terrain at 1800 m depth on a 1982 bathymetric map, but a seamount of about 500 m depth is located about 10 km to the NE. A second eruption from this area was reported in late 1932."

Tongatapu is a coral island at the southern end of an island chain paralleling the Tofua volcanic arc on the east. The volcano, whose first documented eruptions took place in 1911 and 1923, was constructed at the southern end of a submarine ridge segment of the Tofua volcanic arc extending NNE to Falcon Island. Prior to an eruption in 1999, when an ephemeral island was formed, the volcano rose nearly 1400 m to within 13 m of the sea surface."

The two linear andesitic islands are about 2 km long and represent the western and northern remnants of the rim of a largely submarine caldera lying east and south of the islands. Hunga Tonga reaches an elevation of about 114 m above sea level, and both islands display inward-facing sea cliffs with lava and tephra layers dipping gently away from the submarine caldera. A rocky shoal 3.2 km SE of Hunga Ha'apai and 3 km south of Hunga Tonga marks a historically active vent. Several submarine eruptions have occurred at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai since the first historical eruption in 1912. An eruption that began in mid-December 2014 built a new island between the other two large islands."
"Falcon Island","-175.420,-20.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107088.jpg","","The ephemeral Falcon Island in the central part of the Tonga Islands was named after the British vessel H.M.S. Falcon, which reported a shoal in 1865. Falcon Island has been the site of island-forming eruptions on at least two occasions since the 19th century. Islands up to 6 km in length were formed in eruptions beginning in 1885 and 1927; in 1933 the island had a height of more than 145 m. Passing ships often reported 'smoke' issuing from the site of Falcon Island. The latest explosive eruptions were reported in 1936. By 1949 the island had eroded beneath sea level, but the summit of the volcano remains at shallow depths."
"Kao","-175.030,-19.670","The highest and most spectacular volcano of the Tonga Islands, symmetrical Kao volcano rises steeply to 1030 m about 6 km north of Tofua Island. Kao is elongated in a NNE-SSW direction and, with the exception of a small flat area on the SSW coast, rises at angles exceeding 35 degrees to the summit, which has a series of small coalescing craters. The lower flanks of the basaltic-andesite volcano are densely jungled, but the upper slopes are almost vegetation free. No historical eruptions are known from Kao, and fresh-appearing lava flows are not seen, although the absence of sufficient time for erosion to produce deep gullies or high sea cliffs suggests a very recent origin."
"Tofua","-175.070,-19.750","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107097.jpg","","The low, forested Tofua Island in the central part of the Tonga Islands group is the emergent summit of a large stratovolcano that was seen in eruption by Captain Cook in 1774. The first Caucasian to set foot on the 515-m-high island was Capt. William Bligh in 1789, just after the renowned mutiny on the 'Bounty.' The summit contains a 5-km-wide caldera whose walls drop steeply about 500 m. Three post-caldera cones were constructed at the northern end of a cold fresh-water caldera lake, whose surface lies only 30 m above sea level. The easternmost cone has three craters and produced young basaltic-andesite lava flows, some of which traveled into the caldera lake. The largest and northernmost of the cones, Lofia, has a steep-sided crater that is 70 m wide and 120 m deep and has been the source of historical eruptions, first reported in the 18th century. The fumarolically active crater of Lofia has a flat floor formed by a ponded lava flow."
"Metis Shoal","-174.870,-19.180","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/016027.jpg","","Metis Shoal, a submarine volcano midway between the islands of Kao and Late, has produced a series of ephemeral islands since the first confirmed activity in the mid-19th century. An island, perhaps not in eruption, was reported in 1781 and subsequently was eroded away. During periods of inactivity following 20th-century eruptions, waves have been observed to break on rocky reefs or sandy banks with depths of 10 m or less. Dacitic tuff cones formed during the first 20th-century eruptions in 1967 and 1979 were soon eroded beneath the sea surface. An eruption in 1995 produced an island with a diameter of 280 m and a height of 43 m following growth of a lava dome above the surface."

An eruption in 1984 produced a 12-km-high eruption plume, copious amounts of floating pumice, and an ephemeral island 500 x 1500 m wide, with cliffs 30-50 m high that enclosed a water-filled crater. Another island-forming eruption in 2006 produced widespread dacitic pumice rafts that reached as far as Australia."
"Unnamed","-174.365,-18.325","A submarine volcano along the Tofua volcanic arc was first observed in September 2001. The newly discovered volcano lies NW of the island of Vava'u about two-thirds of the way between Late and Fonualei volcanoes. The site of the eruption is along a NNE-SSW-trending submarine plateau south of Fonualei with an approximate bathymetric depth of 300 m. T-phase waves were recorded on September 27-28, and on the 27th local fishermen observed an ash-rich eruption column that rose above the sea surface. No eruptive activity was reported after the 28th, but water discoloration was documented during the following month. In early November rafts and strandings of dacitic pumice were reported along the coast of Kadavu and Viti Levu in the Fiji Islands. The depth of the summit of the submarine cone following the eruption determined to be 40 m during a 2007 survey; the crater of the 2001 eruption was breached to the east."
"Late","-174.650,-18.806","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107092.jpg","","The small, 6-km-wide circular island of Late, lying along the Tofua volcanic arc about 55 km WSW of the island of Vavau, contains a 400-m-wide, 150-m-deep summit crater with an ephemeral lake. The largely submerged basaltic-andesite to andesitic volcano rises 1500 m from the sea floor, with its conical summit reaching 540 m above sea level. Cinder cones are found north of the summit crater, west and north of a semicircular plateau 100-150 m below the summit, and on the NW coast. A graben-like structure on the NE flank contains two large pit craters, the lower of which is partially filled by a saltwater lake. Only two eruptions have occurred in historical time, both from NE-flank craters, which produced explosive activity and possible lava flows in 1790 and 1854."

Tafahi is the northernmost subaerial volcano of the Tofua volcanic arc. The basaltic-andesite volcano is elongated in a N-S direction, and the summit is located at the SW side of the island. The western side of the volcano is the most dissected, and a narrow fringing reef partially encircles the island. No historical eruptions have been reported from Tafahi, but its youthful morphology, which resembles that of the larger Kao volcano in the Central Tonga Islands, suggests recent activity."
"Curacoa","-173.670,-15.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/005001.jpg","","A submarine volcano south of Curacoa Reef at the northern end of the Tofua volcanic arc was first observed in eruption in 1973. Explosive eruptions, which produced large rafts of dacitic pumice covering an area of more than 100 sq km, were observed from the island of Tafahi, 27 km to the SSW. The eruption site was located about 6.5 km SW of Curacoa Reef. Multiple submarine vents are apparently located in this area; a second eruption was reported in 1979 from a location 13 km north of Tafahi."
"Fonualei","-174.325,-18.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107090.jpg","","The small, less than 2-km-wide island of Fonualei contains a fumarolically active crater, which is breached to the SW with a fresh lava flow extending to the sea and forming a rugged shoreline. Steep, inward-facing scarps mark the rim of a partially exposed caldera which contains a pyroclastic cone that is breached to the east and forms the 180-m-high summit of the island. Blocky lava flows from this cone fill much of the northern caldera moat and reach the sea through notches in the northern and eastern caldera rims. In contrast to the andesitic and basaltic rocks of other islands of the Tonga arc, Fonualei lavas are of dominantly dacitic composition. Eruptions have been recorded since 1791, with the largest taking place in June 1846, when explosive eruptions produced large pumice rafts, and ashfall damaged crops on the island of Vavua (56 km away) and fell on vessels up to 950 km distant. In 1939 explosive and effusive activity occurred from summit and flank vents, and water spouts were reported 1.6 km SE of the island."
"Niuafo'ou","-175.630,-15.600","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107100.jpg","","Niuafo'ou ('Tin Can Island') is a low, 8-km-wide island that forms the summit of a largely submerged basaltic shield volcano. Niuafo'ou is an isolated volcanic island in the north central Lau Basin about 170 km west of the northern end of the Tofua volcanic arc. The circular island encloses a 5-km-wide caldera that is mostly filled by a lake whose bottom extends to below sea level. The inner walls of the caldera drop sharply to the caldera lake, named Big Lake (or Vai Lahi), which contains several small islands and pyroclastic cones on its NE shore. Historical eruptions, mostly from circumferential fissures on the west-to-south side of the island, have been recorded since 1814 and have often damaged villages on this small ring-shaped island. A major eruption at Niuafo'ou in 1946 forced evacuation of most of its 1200 inhabitants."

The NELSC is a back-arc spreading center in the northeast part of the Lau Basin. Tafu (Tongan for 'source of fire') rises to about 1400 m below sea level at the NE end of the ridge segment, and Maka (Tongan for 'rock') reaches 1560 m below sea level at the SW end of the ridge segment. A November 2008 NOAA Vents Program expedition discovered submarine hydrothermal plumes consistent with very recent (days to weeks?) submarine lava effusion from Maka volcano. A return visit in May 2009 documented the freshly emplaced lava flow at Maka."

West Mata volcano lies about 7 km west of another submarine volcano, East Mata; both lie at the northern end of the Tonga arc, north of the historically active Curacoa submarine volcano. The two volcanoes were discovered during a November 2008 NOAA Vents Program expedition, and West Mata was found to be producing submarine hydrothermal plumes consistent with a recent or lava effusion. A return visit in May 2009 documented explosive and effusive activity from two closely spaced vents, one at the summit, and the other on the SW rift zone."
"Niuatahi","-174.003,-15.379","Niuatahi is a giant, near circular caldera ~15 km in diameter, with a floor at a depth of about 2 km (Arculus, 2012); it had been preliminarily called 'Volcano O.' A young cone (Motu Tahi) in the SE sector rises 730 m above the floor to a summit depth of 1,270 m. The volcano is in the rear arc of the Tonga system, ~40 km W of the chain of edifices that define the volcanic front of the Tonga Arc, and 25 km E of the spreading ridge of the Northeast Lau Spreading Center. The composition of the cone and surrounding floor is predominantly dacite. Towing with sea floor cameras over the cone and various parts of the caldera in 2012 resulted in the discovery of at least three sources of hydrothermal particle venting on the cone's summit and adjacent to the inner caldera walls. The Tonga Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources named the volcano Niuatahi, which means 'sea' in Tongan, with the small cone of Motutahi meaning 'island in the sea.'"
"Dugong","-175.725,-15.431","This volcano was discovered during an Australian research cruise in 2008. The overall edifice is 45 km in diameter, with a 5-km-diameter summit caldera."

"Vailulu'u","-169.058,-14.215","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117004.jpg","","A massive volcanic seamount, not discovered until 1975, rises 4200 m from the sea floor to a depth of 590 m about one-third of the way between Ta'u and Rose islands at the eastern end of the American Samoas. The basaltic seamount, named Vailulu'u, is considered to mark the current location of the Samoan hotspot. The summit of Vailulu'u contains a 2-km-wide, 400-m-deep oval-shaped caldera. Two principal rift zones extend east and west from the summit, parallel to the trend of the Samoan hotspot, and a third less prominent rift extends SE of the summit. The rift zones and escarpments produced by mass wasting phenomena give the seamount a star-shaped pattern. On July 10, 1973, explosions from Vailulu'u were recorded by SOFAR (hydrophone records of underwater acoustic signals). An earthquake swarm in 1995 may have been related to an eruption from the seamount. Turbid water above the summit shows evidence of ongoing hydrothermal plume activity."
"Ta'u","-169.454,-14.230","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120008.jpg","","The rectangular, 6 x 10 km Ta'u Island, located at the eastern end of the Samoan islands, is ringed by sea cliffs. The 931-m-high island is the emergent portion of the large Lata shield volcano. Collapse and landsliding of the southern portion of the basaltic shield volcano have left an arcuate, south-facing embayment with a steep headwall overlooking several flat benches. Two smaller shields were constructed along two rift zones at the NW and NE tips of the island. The NW corner of the island is extended by a tuff-cone complex that draped sea cliffs and ejected large dunite xenoliths and coral blocks. Numerous Holocene post-caldera cones occur at the summit and flanks of the Lata shield volcano."
"Ofu-Olosega","-169.618,-14.175","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120010.jpg","","The two triangle-shaped islands of Ofu and Olosega in eastern Samoa, with a combined length of 6 km, are separated by a narrow strait. The islands are formed by two eroded, coalescing basaltic shield volcanoes whose slopes dip to the east and west. Steep cliffs up to 600-m high truncate the northern and southern sides of the islands. The narrow, steep-sided ridge forming the eastern tip of Ofu Island consists of a dike complex. The shield volcano on Ofu is cut on the north by the A'ofa caldera; bathymetry suggests that a caldera may also exist on the Sili shield volcano of Olosega. The Nu'utele tuff cone, forming a small crescent-shaped island immediately off the west end of Ofu Island, is Holocene in age. A submarine eruption took place in 1866 at the opposite end of the two islands, 3 km SE of Olosega, along the ridge connecting Olosega with Ta'u Island."
"Tutuila","-170.700,-14.295","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120007.jpg","","The elongated, extensively eroded Tutuila Island in the center of the Samoan Islands consists of five Pliocene-to-Pleistocene volcanoes constructed along two or three rifts trending SSW-NNE. The Pago basaltic-to-andesitic shield volcano in the center of the 32-km-long island is truncated by an eroded, 9-km-wide caldera that encloses Pago Pago harbor on its west side. The caldera is now partially filled by cinder cones and trachytic lava domes. ENE-trending dike complexes are prominently exposed on Pago volcano. Following a lengthy period of erosion, submergence, and the construction of a barrier reef, the Leone volcanics were erupted during the Holocene along a 5-km-long N-S-trending fissure over a broad area at the southernmost part of the island (Stearns, 1944), forming a group of initially submarine tuff cones and subsequent subaerial cinder cones that produced fresh-looking pahoehoe lava flows."
"Upolu","-171.720,-13.935","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119016.jpg","","The massive, basaltic shield volcano forming 75-km-long Upolu Island in Samoa is elongated in an E-W direction and was constructed during two periods of extensive eruptions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The most extensive activity during the Pleistocene took place along a 20-km segment along the central axis of the island. Following a lengthy period of erosion, the latest lava flows, at least three of which were estimated to be as young as a few hundred to a few thousand years old, were erupted from vents near the crest of the island at its center and western side (Stearns, 1944). One of the youngest flows reached the north-central coast along a roughly 1.5-km-wide front east of Vailele Bay, and another traveled down the Lefaga River channel and reached the SW coast at Lefaga Bay. Apolima Island off the western tip of Upolu is a Holocene tuff cone too young to be fringed by a coral reef, and other reef-free areas along the coastline may be formed by Holocene lava flows."
"Savai'i","-172.525,-13.612","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119015.jpg","","Savai'i, the largest and highest of the Samoan islands, consists of a massive basaltic shield volcano constructed along a WNW-ESE-trending rift zone that splits into two rifts on the east side of the 75-km-long, oval-shaped island. Pliocene and Pleistocene shield formation was followed by stream and marine erosion, partial submergence, and growth of coral reefs. Late-stage Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions produced voluminous lava flows that partially buried fringing reefs. Numerous cinder cones and lava cones dot the broad crest of Savai'i, which has a low-angle, dome-like profile and reaches an elevation of 1858 m. Additional cones occur on the north-central flank, and a large number are found in the south-central part of the island. Three eruptions, including two in the 20th century, occurred in historical time, and produced voluminous lava flows that reached the northern coast along broad fronts up to about 15 km wide, destroying several villages and overtopping fringing reefs."
"Wallis Islands","-176.170,-13.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104066.jpg","","The Wallis Islands consist of one relatively large island, 7 x 14 km Uvea Island, and 22 smaller islands and islets that are surrounded by a barrier reef. The low, forested islands, formed of flat-lying basaltic lava flows that are cut by explosion craters and capped by tuff cones and cinder cones, reach a maximum height of only 143 m above sea level. Numerous small shields (lava cones) and tuff cones are considered on morphological grounds to be of Pleistocene to Recent age (Stearns, 1945). Potassium-Argon ages of dated samples range from 0.5 to 0.08 million years old, but rocks of Pleistocene or Holocene age are present (Price et al., 1991)."
"Taveuni","-179.970,-16.820","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104052.jpg","","Straddling the 180 degree meridian, Taveuni, the third largest of the Fiji islands, is known as the 'Garden Island' as a result of its rich volcanic soils. The massive, elongated basaltic shield volcano rises to 1241 m and is dotted by approximately 150 volcanic cones along a NE-SW rift that extends the length of the 40-km-long island. A few cones in the central part of the volcano occur to the west of the axial rift zone. At least 58 eruptions have occurred on Taveuni since the first known human settlements of the Fiji Islands about 950-750 BCE; all of these eruptions affected the southern two-thirds of the island. A period of voluminous eruptions between about 300 and 500 CE caused abandonment of the southern part the island of Taveuni until about 1100 CE. The latest known eruption produced a lava flow at the southern tip of the island sometime between about 1450-1650 CE."
"Koro","179.400,-17.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104030.jpg","","The 16 x 9 km, shark-tooth-shaped Koro Island, located between Fiji's Viti Levu and Vanua Levu Islands, is part of the volcanic Lomaiviti Islands. A chain of basaltic cinder cones of upper Pleistocene or possibly Holocene age extends from north to south along the crest of the island (Coulson, 1976). With the exception of one location on the west coast where young lava flows reached the sea, the youngest lava flows, erupted from the NNE-SSW-trending cinder cone chain, are confined to the central plateau, where they form a flat, undissected lava field that extends primarily to the east."
"Nabukelevu","177.980,-19.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110077.jpg","","The andesitic-to-dacitic Nabukelevu lava-dome complex occupies the SW end of Kadavu Island at the southern end of the Fiji archipelago. The high point of the Nabukelevu complex is 805 m Mt. Washington, an andesitic lava dome. Flat-lying dacitic lava flows are found at Cape Washington along the west coast and at Talaulia Bay on the NE coast. NNE-trending faults cut the complex in several locations and define its eastern boundary. The dome complex is cut by several collapse scarps that were the source of debris avalanches that have incorporated human artifacts and remains. Debris avalanches have entered the sea on the both the northern and southern sides of the volcano. Onshore and offshore deposits as well as native legends indicate that several eruptions have occurred at Nabukelevu during the Holocene. Block-and-ash flows related to dome growth have occurred within the past few hundred years."
"St. Andrew Strait","147.350,-2.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004034.jpg","","The St. Andrew Strait volcano, located in the Admiralty Islands north of Papua New Guinea, consists of a series of overlapping Quaternary cones formed by rhyolitic lava flows and pyroclastic materials on Lou and Tuluman Islands. Volcanism is aligned on a curved arc extending through the 12-km-long Lou Island, which may represent an incipient caldera ring fracture. The historically active Tuluman Islands, 1.5 km south of Lou Island, were formed during a 1953-1957 eruption. Pam Lin and Pam Mandian Islands farther to the SE along the same arc contain fresh rhyolitic obsidian similar to that found on Tuluman."
"Baluan","147.280,-2.570","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115024.jpg","","The circular, 5.5-km-wide island of Baluan in the Admiralty Islands is formed by a Pleistocene stratovolcano with a large summit crater and several flank vents. Some of these might be of Holocene age (Johnson 1990, pers. comm.). In contrast to its neighboring islands to the north, Baluan has erupted basaltic rather than rhyolitic rocks. Sabroma, the elliptical summit crater, has a maximum width of about 1 km. The arcuate rim of the Batapona Mountain pyroclastic cone is prominent at the north edge of the island. Several small islands consisting of cone remnants are located within a kilometer of the north coast. Warm springs occur along the coast. The only historical activity is an uncertain report of a submarine eruption near the island in 1931."
"Unnamed","147.780,-3.030","SOFAR signals resembling those produced at known submarine eruptions were recorded in January 1972 at a location in the central Bismarck Sea (Johnson et al, 1981). The source of the signals was at the junction of two segments of the northern margin of the South Bismarck plate. The more easterly of these segments is a transform fault, whereas the more westerly is an area of oblique active seafloor spreading. The signals were detected at a seismic station on nearby Manus Island, as well as at hydrophone stations on Wake and Midway Islands in the central Pacific."
"Blup Blup","144.605,-3.507","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111008.jpg","","The small, 3.5-km-wide forested island of Blup Blup contains lava flows with well-defined flow fronts. A weak thermal area is located on the west coast, and another on the north coast. Most eruptive activity at the andesitic-dacitic volcano originated from a thickly wooded summit crater about 800 m in diameter, although a lava dome may be present on a ridge to the west, and a small satellite cone occurs along the SW coast. Reports of eruptions during historical time are erroneous, but the island may have erupted during the Holocene (Johnson 1990, pers. comm.). Blocks from a submarine debris avalanche lie to the NE of the island."
"Kadovar","144.588,-3.608","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111007.jpg","","The 2-km-wide island of Kadovar is the emergent summit of a Bismarck Sea stratovolcano of Holocene age. Kadovar is part of the Schouten Islands, and lies off the coast of New Guinea, about 25 km N of the mouth of the Sepik River. The village of Gewai is perched on the crater rim. A 365-m-high lava dome forming the high point of the andesitic volcano fills an arcuate landslide scarp that is open to the south, and submarine debris-avalanche deposits occur in that direction. Thick lava flows with columnar jointing forms low cliffs along the coast. The youthful island lacks fringing or offshore reefs. No certain historical eruptions are known; the latest activity was a period of heightened thermal phenomena in 1976."
"Boisa","144.963,-3.994","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004037.jpg","","The small, 1.4 x 1.7 km Boisa, or Aris Island consists of a large basaltic-andesitic cone with a summit crater open to the north whose rim extends to the island's east coast. The crater of the basaltic older cone is filled by two steep-sided andesitic lava domes, the highest of which forms the 240-m high point of the island. A third lava dome, separated from the eastern cone by a low saddle, forms a peninsula on the western side of the island. No historical eruptions or present-day thermal activity have been observed, although the last eruption may have been quite recent judging by the youthful morphology of the island (Gust and Johnson, 1981)."
"Bam","144.818,-3.613","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004036.jpg","","The small 2.4 x 1.6 km island of Bam is the summit of a mostly submerged volcano that is one of the more active in Papua New Guinea. Bam is the SE-most of the Schouten Islands, and lies off the coast of New Guinea, about 40 km NNE of the mouth of the Sepik River. A steep-walled summit crater that is 300 m wide and 180 m deep is the source of Bam's recent eruptions, which have kept the upper half of the cone sparsely vegetated. A NE-trending landslide scarp extends across the upper part of the andesitic volcano from the SW coast, and a large submarine debris-avalanche deposits lies to the south and SW. The younger summit cone partially buries the eastern side of the collapse scarp. A recent lava platform on the north flank supports the small island's only villages. Historical eruptions, recorded since 1872, have been restricted to small-to-moderate explosive activity from the summit crater."
"Manam","145.037,-4.080","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004038.jpg","","The 10-km-wide island of Manam, lying 13 km off the northern coast of mainland Papua New Guinea, is one of the country's most active volcanoes. Four large radial valleys extend from the unvegetated summit of the conical 1807-m-high basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano to its lower flanks. These 'avalanche valleys' channel lava flows and pyroclastic avalanches that have sometimes reached the coast. Five small satellitic centers are located near the island's shoreline on the northern, southern, and western sides. Two summit craters are present; both are active, although most historical eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley. Frequent historical eruptions, typically of mild-to-moderate scale, have been recorded since 1616. Occasional larger eruptions have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached flat-lying coastal areas and entered the sea, sometimes impacting populated areas."
"Karkar","145.964,-4.649","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004041.jpg","","Karkar is a 19 x 25 km wide, forest-covered island that is truncated by two nested summit calderas. The 5.5-km-wide outer caldera was formed during one or more eruptions, the last of which occurred 9000 years ago. The eccentric 3.2-km-wide inner caldera was formed sometime between 1500 and 800 years ago. Parasitic cones are present on the N and S flanks of this basaltic-to-andesitic volcano; a linear array of small cones extends from the northern rim of the outer caldera nearly to the coast. Most historical eruptions, which date back to 1643, have originated from Bagiai cone, a pyroclastic cone constructed within the steep-walled, 300-m-deep inner caldera. The floor of the caldera is covered by young, mostly unvegetated andesitic lava flows."
"Hankow Reef","146.717,-4.883","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115046.jpg","","Oral tradition suggests the possible existence of a now-submerged volcano off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Accounts from many villages along Madang coast report that residents fled from Yomba Island 8-10 generations ago when the island was destroyed by an eruption accompanied by a tsunami. The location of the former island is uncertain, but most informants placed it in the vicinity of the present-day Hankow Reef (Mennis, 1981), between Bagabag and Crown Islands, NW of Long Island. Binns et al. (2002) surveyed the area, locating two distinct seamounts as well as a caldera SW of the reef; they found no evidence for the existence of the legendary Yomba volcano."
"Long Island","147.120,-5.358","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004052.jpg","","The broad profile of hexagonal-shaped Long Island is dominated by two steep-sided stratovolcanoes, Mount Reaumur in the north and Cerisy Peak in the south. Collapse of the basaltic-andesitic volcanic complex produced a large 10 x 12.5 km caldera, now filled by Lake Wisdom. Caldera formation occurred during at least three major explosive eruptions, about 16,000, 4000, and 300 years ago. The latter was one of the largest historical eruptions in Papua New Guinea and deposited andesitic tephra across the New Guinea highlands, prompting legends of a 'Time of Darkness.' Post-caldera eruptions have constructed a small cone, Motmot Island, in the south-central part of Lake Wisdom. Moderate explosive eruptions have occurred during the 20th century from vents at and near Motmot Island."
"Umboi","147.875,-5.589","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104060.jpg","","Umboi Island, 50 km in its longest dimension, is the largest of the volcanic islands off the N coast of New Guinea. Dominantly basaltic-andesitic, it is comprised of several coalescing stratovolcanoes cut by a 13 x 17 km caldera whose walls rise up to 1 km above its floor. The caldera is widely breached to the sea on the NE side and contains three youthful post-caldera cones with summit crater lakes, Talo, Soal, and Barik. The largest of these cones, 1494-m-high Talo, displays several thermal areas and has satellitic cones on its flanks. No historical eruptions have been reported, but activity of the post-caldera cones is thought to have continued until the last few hundred years (Johnson et al., 1972)."
"Ritter Island","148.115,-5.519","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004055.jpg","","Prior to 1888, Ritter Island was a steep-sided, nearly circular island about 780 m high. The current small, 140-m-high island is a topographically insignificant, 1900-m-long arcuate feature between Umboi and Sakar Islands. Several historical explosive eruptions had been recorded prior to 1888, when large-scale slope failure destroyed the summit of the conical basaltic-andesitic volcano, leaving the arcuate 140-m-high island remnant with a steep west-facing scarp that descends below sea level. Devastating tsunamis were produced by the collapse and swept the coast of Papua New Guinea and offshore islands. Two minor post-collapse explosive eruptions, during 1972 and 1974, occurred offshore within the largely submarine 3.5 x 4.5 km breached depression formed by the collapse."
"Sakar","148.094,-5.414","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104012.jpg","","Sakar is an incised stratovolcano with a summit crater lake. Deep valleys cut the flanks of the volcano, which is partially surrounded by coral reefs. An older volcano that forms much of the island consists mainly of porphyritic basaltic rocks. A younger andesitic cone with a 1.5-km-wide crater has been constructed within the older volcano's larger crater, whose rim is exposed on the northern and eastern sides. No historical eruptions are known from Sakar, but warm springs are found along the SW coast, and a pyroclastic cone on the southern flank of the 8 x 10 km wide island may be of Holocene age (Johnson 1990, pers. comm.). A large submarine debris-avalanche deposit lies north of Sakar."
"Langila","148.420,-5.525","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004056.jpg","","Langila, one of the most active volcanoes of New Britain, consists of a group of four small overlapping composite basaltic-andesitic cones on the lower eastern flank of the extinct Talawe volcano. Talawe is the highest volcano in the Cape Gloucester area of NW New Britain. A rectangular, 2.5-km-long crater is breached widely to the SE; Langila volcano was constructed NE of the breached crater of Talawe. An extensive lava field reaches the coast on the north and NE sides of Langila. Frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, have been recorded since the 19th century from three active craters at the summit of Langila. The youngest and smallest crater (no. 3 crater) was formed in 1960 and has a diameter of 150 m."
"Mundua","149.350,-4.630","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115023.jpg","","A cluster of basaltic volcanoes forms the Mundua Islands. The largest volcanic center is formed by the western tip of the 7-km-wide, linear Mundua Island and the arcuate Wingoru Island immediately to the west. The crater of this volcano is flooded by the sea through narrow channels on the northern and southern sides; remnants of crater walls form Wingoru island and are exposed at the western tip of Mundua island. Five small cones occupy the central and eastern sides of Mundua. Two of these have well-preserved craters and are of Holocene age (Johnson and Blake, 1972)."
"Garove","149.500,-4.692","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115022.jpg","","Garove is the largest of the Witu Islands, which lie north of New Britain. The low, 12-km-wide elongated island is cut by a 5-km-wide caldera that is flooded by the sea through a narrow breach on the southern side of the island, forming Johann Albrecht harbor. The steep-sided caldera walls rise 100-150 m above the sea. Satellitic cones were constructed along the NE and SW coasts. No historical eruptions are known, but the preservation of fresh lava flow structures on the NW coast suggests an age as young as a few hundred years (Johnson and Blake, 1972). Fisher (1957) noted four thermal areas and a solfatara on the island."
"Dakataua","150.094,-5.094","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004059.jpg","","The 10.5 x 13.5 km Dakataua caldera, anchoring the northern tip of the Willaumez Peninsula, is one of New Britain's most dramatic volcanoes. A major submarine debris-avalanche deposit NE of the volcano may represent edifice collapse prior to caldera formation. The latest episode of caldera formation occurred as recently as about 1150 years ago, and was followed by at least five subplinian or vulcanian eruptions. A 12-km-wide, freshwater lake whose surface is only about 50 m above sea level occupies the caldera. Two vertical fault-bounded blocks form topographic highs at the western and eastern sides of the caldera. A N-S-trending line of post-caldera cones, explosion craters, and part of an arcuate inner caldera rim form a large peninsula that nearly bisects the horseshoe-shaped caldera lake. The peninsula includes the 350-m-high andesitic Mount Makalia stratovolcano, the largest of the post-caldera cones, which last erupted during the late-19th century. Thermal areas occur at several locations along the central peninsula."
"Bola","150.038,-5.141","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107065.jpg","","Bola volcano (also known as Wangore) is a symmetrical stratovolcano, located immediately SW of Dakataua caldera, that forms the 1155-m high point of the Willaumez Peninsula. The forested andesitic cone has a well-preserved, 400-m-wide crater with a 100-m-high eastern wall and a low western rim. Three large explosion craters occupy the NE flank. The most recent lava flow issued from the summit crater and flowed to the west. This viscous flow is at least 50 m thick, leaving an irregularity in the profile of the volcano. The pristine summit crater and weak fumarolic activity suggested to Lowder and Carmichael (1970) that the most recent eruption may have been only a few hundred years ago."
"Garua Harbour","150.070,-5.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111020.jpg","","The Garua (Talasea) Harbour volcanic field consists of a group of lava domes and ash cones of possible Holocene age. These volcanic vents ring the harbor on the west and form Garua Island to the east. Much of the volcanic field, including the two lava domes on Garua Island, consists of rhyolitic rocks. Active hot springs ring the shores of Garua Harbour and are best developed on the north and south sides. Large boiling pools, fumaroles, and small geysers are found on the north shore near Pangalu village. Another large group of boiling pools, fumaroles, and mudpots is located near the Talasea Government Station on the south shore of the bay."
"Lolo","150.509,-5.466","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107071.jpg","","Lolo is a small, nearly symmetrical 796-m-high andesitic stratovolcano located north of Witori volcano along the north coast of New Britain near Cape Hoskins. It is of very late Pleistocene or Holocene age and overlaps the older Kapberg volcano to the west (Blake and McDougall, 1973). Lava flows are prominent on its flanks, and a well-preserved crater 250-m wide and 60-m deep truncates the summit of the stratovolcano."
"Krummel-Garbuna-Welcker Volcanic Complex","150.027,-5.416","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107072.jpg","","This basaltic-to-dacitic complex consists of three volcanic peaks, Krummel, Garbuna, and Welcker. They are located along a 7-km N-S line above a shield-like foundation at the southern end of the Willaumez Peninsula. The central and lower peaks of the centrally located 564-m-high Garbuna volcano contain a large vegetation-free area that is probably the most extensive thermal field in Papua New Guinea. A prominent lava dome and blocky lava flow in the center of thermal area have resisted destruction by thermal activity, and may be of Holocene age. The 854-m-high Krummel volcano at the south end of the group contains a summit crater, breached to the NW. The highest peak of the Garbuna group is 1064-m-high Welcker volcano, which has fed blocky lava flows that extend to the eastern coast of the peninsula. The last major eruption from both it and Garbuna volcanoes took place about 1800 years ago. The first historical eruption of the complex took place at Garbuna in October 2005."
"Witori","150.516,-5.576","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/106012.jpg","","The 5.5 x 7.5 km Witori caldera on the northern coast of central New Britain contains the young historically active cone of Pago. The Buru caldera cuts the SW flank of Witori volcano. The gently sloping outer flanks of Witori volcano consist primarily of dacitic pyroclastic-flow and airfall deposits produced during a series of five major explosive eruptions from about 5600 to 1200 years ago, many of which may have been associated with caldera formation. The post-caldera Pago cone may have formed less than 350 years ago. Pago has grown to a height above that of the Witori caldera rim, and a series of ten dacitic lava flows from it covers much of the caldera floor. The youngest of these was erupted during 2002-2003 from vents extending from the summit nearly to the NW caldera wall."
"Sulu Range","150.942,-5.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117049.jpg","","The Sulu Range consists of a cluster of partially overlapping small stratovolcanoes and lava domes in north-central New Britain off Bangula Bay. The 610-m Mount Malopu at the southern end forms the high point of the basaltic-to-rhyolitic complex. Kaiamu maar forms a peninsula with a small lake extending about 1 km into Bangula Bay at the NW side of the Sulu Range. The Walo hydrothermal area, consisting of solfataras and mud pots, lies on the coastal plain west of the SW base of the Sulu Range. No historical eruptions are known from the Sulu Range, although some of the cones display a relatively undissected morphology. A vigorous new fumarolic vent opened in 2006, preceded by vegetation die-off, seismicity, and dust-producing landslides."
"Hargy","151.100,-5.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111019.jpg","","This little-known volcano is one of several major calderas on the island of New Britain. The 10 x 12 km Hargy caldera, whose floor is 150 m above sea level, contains an inner caldera with a steep west-facing wall. A caldera lake on the SE side drains through a narrow gap in the northern caldera wall. The latest caldera-forming eruption of Hargy volcano took place about 11,000 years ago. The dacitic Galloseulo lava cone rises above and partially overtops the western rim of the caldera. A double crater occupies a larger 700-m-wide crater. Numerous small eruptions have taken place at Galloseulo over the past 7000 years, the last occurring about 1000 years ago."
"Bamus","151.230,-5.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/060090.jpg","","Symmetrical 2248-m-high Bamus volcano, also referred to locally as the South Son, is located SW of Ulawun volcano, known as the Father. These two volcanoes are the highest in the 1000-km-long Bismarck volcanic arc. The andesitic stratovolcano is draped by rainforest and contains a breached summit crater filled with a lava dome. A satellitic cone is located on the southern flank, and a prominent 1.5-km-wide crater with two small adjacent cones is situated halfway up the SE flank. Young pyroclastic-flow deposits are found on the volcano's flanks, and villagers describe an eruption that took place during the late 19th century."
"Ulawun","151.330,-5.050","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004062.jpg","","The symmetrical basaltic-to-andesitic Ulawun stratovolcano is the highest volcano of the Bismarck arc, and one of Papua New Guinea's most frequently active. Ulawun volcano, also known as the Father, rises above the north coast of the island of New Britain across a low saddle NE of Bamus volcano, the South Son. The upper 1000 m of the 2334-m-high Ulawun volcano is unvegetated. A prominent E-W-trending escarpment on the south may be the result of large-scale slumping. Satellitic cones occupy the NW and eastern flanks. A steep-walled valley cuts the NW side of Ulawun volcano, and a flank lava-flow complex lies to the south of this valley. Historical eruptions date back to the beginning of the 18th century. Twentieth-century eruptions were mildly explosive until 1967, but after 1970 several larger eruptions produced lava flows and basaltic pyroclastic flows, greatly modifying the summit crater."
"Lolobau","151.158,-4.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/016053.jpg","","Lolobau volcano sits astride the western rim of a 6-km-wide caldera, which formed about 12,000 years ago. The 8 x 13 km, oval-shaped Lolobau Island is located just off the coast of eastern New Britain. A small lake occupies the SW part of the caldera. A small lava dome (Hulu) caps Mount Lolobau, which has a 0.8 x 1.1 km summit crater that is breached to the NE. Flank cones are found along the coast of the largely submerged volcano. Several vents within the caldera along an E-W-trending line on the eastern flank of Mount Lolobau have been active during historical time. The latest eruptions took place during the early-20th century."
"Rabaul","152.203,-4.271","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004068.jpg","","The low-lying Rabaul caldera on the tip of the Gazelle Peninsula at the NE end of New Britain forms a broad sheltered harbor utilized by what was the island's largest city prior to a major eruption in 1994. The outer flanks of the 688-m-high asymmetrical pyroclastic shield volcano are formed by thick pyroclastic-flow deposits. The 8 x 14 km caldera is widely breached on the east, where its floor is flooded by Blanche Bay and was formed about 1400 years ago. An earlier caldera-forming eruption about 7100 years ago is now considered to have originated from Tavui caldera, offshore to the north. Three small stratovolcanoes lie outside the northern and NE caldera rims. Post-caldera eruptions built basaltic-to-dacitic pyroclastic cones on the caldera floor near the NE and western caldera walls. Several of these, including Vulcan cone, which was formed during a large eruption in 1878, have produced major explosive activity during historical time. A powerful explosive eruption in 1994 occurred simultaneously from Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes and forced the temporary abandonment of Rabaul city."
"Tavui","152.200,-4.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110045.jpg","","The spectacular mostly submarine Tavui caldera lies off the NE tip of the Gazelle Peninsula north of Rabaul caldera. The caldera was first discovered during a bathymetric cruise in 1985. The SW wall of the roughly 10 x 12 km wide caldera cuts the NE end of the peninsula and extends from Tavui Point at the northern tip of the peninsula SE to Laweo Point. The 7100-year-old Raluan Ignimbrite, initially thought to have originated from Rabaul, is now thought to have been produced by an eruption of Tavui. A basaltic scoria layer immediately underlies the rhyolitic ignimbrite, and the introduction of basaltic magma was considered to have triggered the rhyolitic eruption. The lack of a major low-velocity region detectable beneath the caldera during a seismic tomography survey suggests that it is not currently active."
"Narage","149.125,-4.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120099.jpg","","The small forested island of Narage is the northernmost of the Witu (or Vitu) Islands, which lie north of western New Britain. Narage is the 307-m-high summit of a Pleistocene stratovolcano that displays strong thermal activity. Narage was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Fisher, 1957) based on its geothermal activity. Boiling springs and a geyser are found along the SE and SW coasts; in 1863 a geyser 45 m high was observed at a sandbank 8 km offshore. A fringing reef, prominent on satellite imagery, encircles the island at a distance of 200 m to 400 m and encloses a narrow lagoon."
"Doma Peaks","143.150,-5.900","Doma Peaks, at the western end of a volcanic chain in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, rise to 3568 m and are dominated by two westward-facing escarpments of probable landslide origin. Satellite cones and lava domes occur on the NE and southern flanks of the dominantly andesitic volcano. There is no evidence for magmatic eruptions within the last few hundred or possibly few thousand years (Mackenzie and Johnson, 1984). A reported eruption within the past few hundred years was actually from Long Island, and an older lahar mentioned by Blong (1979) was not accompanied by any significant tephra production (Blong, 1982)."
"Crater Mountain","145.080,-6.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117012.jpg","","Crater Mountain, an arcuate chain of peaks 3000 m or more in height, is extensively eroded to the point that its volcanic origin is almost unrecognizable. However, steep-sided valleys to the north and east are floored by lava flows and other young volcanic features. The easternmost Agotu Valley contains several small craters, cinder cones, and maars of late-Pleistocene or Holocene age (Mackenzie and Johnson, 1984). Several small cones, lava domes, and associated lava flows north and NW of the Erun Anticline may in part be Holocene in age."
"Yelia","145.858,-7.050","Mount Yelia, first recognized as a volcano in 1963, contains a group of andesitic lava domes in the summit area and NW flank. Marble Peak is an older volcanic center immediately to the south. The largest dome in the summit crater is perforated by at least 11 craters. Two large steep-sided, flat-topped lava domes occupy the NNE flank, and two smaller domes are located to the west. The last significant eruption occurred about 18,000 years ago, and no direct evidence for Holocene eruptions has been observed. Weak solfataric activity is present and there was an unverified report from local inhabitants of an eruption during the early 1940's. Weak fumarolic activity continues in the summit crater."
"Koranga","146.708,-7.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004083.jpg","","Koranga Crater, a Pliocene-to-Holocene hydrothermal explosion vent complex (Pigram et al., 1977), is located in the Morobe goldfields in the Owen Stanley Range SW of Huon Gulf. The gold mineralization here prompted one of the world's last great gold rushes, beginning in 1922. Gold mineralization is thought to have been related to Pliocene maar formation and dacitic and andesitic lava dome extrusion. Gas emission and a landslide from Koranga in May 1967 were considered to have had either a non-volcanic (Pigram et al., 1977; Fisher and Branch, 1981) or hydrothermal-eruption origin (Sillitoe et al., 1984)."
"Madilogo","147.570,-9.200","Madilogo is an isolated, well-preserved pyroclastic cone located on the SW side of the Owen Stanley Range about 50 km NE of Port Moresby. The small volcano, which was not recognized until 1969, rises about 250 m from the flood plain of the Naoro River. A lava flow extends 1 km to the west from the breached summit crater. The pyroclastic cone and lava flow were considered on the basis of revegetation rates and soil profiles to probably be less than 1000 years old and possibly as young as a few hundred years (Blake, 1976)."
"Hydrographers Range","148.370,-9.000","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004084.jpg","","The Hydrographers Range is a forested, deeply dissected andesitic volcanic massif extending from the eastern margin of Mount Lamington north to the coast of eastern Papua New Guinea. Most activity took place during the Pleistocene, but perfectly preserved cinder cones and explosion craters on the southern side of the range suggested that some activity took place during the Holocene (Taylor, 1958). Other well-preserved cones are situated in the high country overlooking Songade village on the coast."
"Lamington","148.150,-8.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004090.jpg","","Lamington is an andesitic stratovolcano with a 1.3-km-wide breached summit crater containing a lava dome. Prior to its renowned devastating eruption in 1951, the forested peak had not been recognized as a volcano. Mount Lamington rises to 1680 m above the coastal plain north of the Owen Stanley Range. A summit complex of lava domes and crater remnants rises above a low-angle base of volcaniclastic deposits that are dissected by radial valleys. A prominent broad 'avalanche valley' extends northward from the breached crater. Ash layers from two early Holocene eruptions at Lamington have been identified. After a long quiescent period, the volcano sprang suddenly to life in 1951, producing a powerful explosive eruption during which devastating pyroclastic flows and surges swept all sides of the volcano, killing nearly 3000 persons. The eruption concluded with growth of a 560-m-high lava dome in the summit crater."
"Managlase Plateau","148.330,-9.080","Thirty small volcanic centers of late-Pleistocene to Holocene age are located in SE Papua New Guinea on the Managlase Plateau, south of the Hydrographers Range and SW of the Dyke Ackland Bay. The fault-bounded plateau forms a triangular-shaped area dotted with trachybasaltic lava cones and flows, scoria mounds, cinder cones, and explosion vents of the Uoivi Volcanics and capped on its eastern side by rhyodacitic ash cones, lava domes, and ashflow deposits of the Manna Volcanics . The date of the most recent eruption on the Managlase Plateau is not known, but the trachybasaltic Kururui cinder cone and a nearby explosion crater were active within memory of nearby villagers (Ruxton, 1966)."
"Sessagara","149.130,-9.480","The low-lying Sessagara Hills, located near the mouth of the Uiaka River, south of Collingwood Bay, is a small alkalic andesitic volcanic field in eastern Papua New Guinea. The age of the most recent eruption is not known, although the field clearly included Holocene volcanic activity (Smith, 1981). Two of the cones north of the Goropu Mountains display preserved summit craters and were probably active during the Holocene; other cones may be of Pleistocene age."
"Victory","149.070,-9.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111009.jpg","","The dominantly andesitic Mount Victory stratovolcano occupies the Cape Nelson area on the NE coast of Papua New Guinea. Mount Victory is densely mantled by rainforest, which is somewhat stunted near the summit. On the NE it abutts the deeply dissected Pleistocene Mount Trafalgar volcano. The summit crater of Mount Victory is breached to the SE and is of possible landslide origin. Several near-summit lava domes are present, the SE-most of which marks the 1925-m-high summit of the volcano. Four small satellite cones are located on the SW side, and two others occur on the NE flank. The only confirmed historical activity of Mount Victory was a long-term late-19th to early 20th-century eruption that provided a beacon for passing ships. Pyroclastic flows that destroyed several villages and caused fatalities reached the coast."
"Goodenough","150.350,-9.480","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107070.jpg","","Goodenough is a roughly circular volcanic island that is the westernmost of the D'Entrecasteaux Islands off the NE tip of Papua New Guinea. Several basaltic-andesite and andesitic Holocene eruptive centers that may be only a few hundred years old are located around the margins of fault-bounded metamorphic rocks that form the central part of Goodenough Island. The youngest volcanic features, which include the Walilagi Cones, are located at the SE end of the island. These well-developed ash cones and blocky lava flows on the northern and eastern flanks of the Bwaido Peninsula may have erupted within the past few hundred years."
"Waiowa","149.075,-9.570","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/061001.jpg","","Waiowa (also known as Goropu) is an isolated pyroclastic cone that was formed during 1943-44 by explosive eruptions through Paleozoic to pre-Cambrian metamorphic rocks. The trachyandesitic volcano was born in an area of the eastern Papuan Peninsula without previous volcanic activity. Intermittent minor explosions beginning 18 September 1943 preceded the first major explosion on 27 December. Additional large explosions occurred on 13 February and 23 July 1944, leveling 80 sq km of forest. Following the final activity on 31 August, the topographically insignificant volcano was capped by a 500-m-wide, steep-walled crater that is now densely forested and contains a small lake."
"Iamalele","150.530,-9.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/108066.jpg","","An area of youthful volcanism and active thermal fields is located on the SW part of Fergusson Island, in the center of the D'Entrecasteaux island group. The Iamalele-Fagululu area contains a series of lava domes and lava flows of probable Holocene age in association with abundant hot springs and fumaroles (Smith 1981). Two small lava domes are located near Fagululu village, the largest of which is a 150-m-high flat-topped, obsidian-bearing rhyolitic dome. Six other lava domes are clustered around Salt Lake on the western side of the area. Hot springs, boiling springs, fumaroles, and mud pools are found in an area of siliceous sinter near Iamalele village."
"Dawson Strait Group","150.880,-9.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115025.jpg","","The Dawson Straits, located between eastern Fergusson and western Normanby Islands in the D'Entrecasteaux island group, contains a volcanic field with several volcanic centers that define a possible partly submerged caldera. There have been no historical eruptions from this center, but morphology suggests an extremely young age for some lava flows, and the area displays vigorous thermal activity. The most prominent volcanic centers are Mounts Lamonai and Oiau, located about 10 km apart on the SW tip of Fergusson Island. The 500-m-high summit of Lamonai is capped by a steep-walled crater, and rhyolitic lava flows are exposed on the NE side of the cone. Dominantly volcaniclastic Oiau cone has also produced obsidian lava flows. Dobu Island to the south is formed of coalescing volcanic centers and likewise has produced youthful rhyolitic obsidian flows."
"Lihir","152.642,-3.125","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107067.jpg","","Lihir Island, the largest of an island group north of New Ireland, is a Pliocene-to-Holocene volcanic complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes. The youngest volcano, Luise, contains an elliptical, 5.5-km-wide caldera that is breached by the sea on the NE side as a result of edifice collapse about 0.4 million years ago, forming Luise Harbor. The flanks of the volcano are only moderately dissected. The steep-sided caldera wall rises to 700 m above sea level. A central lava plug is strongly hydrothermally altered and displays extensive thermal activity along its margins. Thermal activity includes boiling hot springs, mud pools, and sulfur-encrusted low-temperature fumaroles. The Ladolam hydrothermal deposit hosts one of the youngest and largest gold deposits in the world, which is now being extracted by open-pit mining. The near-surface, epithermal gold deposition extends to about 400 m below sea level over an area of about 2 sq km."
"Ambitle","153.650,-4.080","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107068.jpg","","Ambitle is the larger of two adjacent islands forming the Feni Islands, which are located near the SE end of an island chain north and east of New Ireland. This dominantly Pliocene-to-Pleistocene stratovolcano is characterized by a variety of alkalic rocks types. A 3-km-wide central caldera was constructed over Tertiary marine limestone deposits and is occupied by late-Pleistocene trachytic lava domes. A maar on the eastern side of the domes formed about 2300 years ago. Several thermal areas, consisting of hot and boiling springs, mud pools, and low-temperature fumaroles, are found on the western side of the caldera floor and near the western edge of the central lava dome. Shallow-water hydrothermal venting also occurs in a coral reef environment just off the western coast of the island. Babase Island, immediately to the NE of Ambitle, is composed of a Pleistocene stratovolcano and lava dome connected by a narrow isthmus."
"Tanga","153.220,-3.500","Malendok, Lif and Tefa islands are remnants of the summit of a mostly submerged stratovolcano. In the center of the caldera, the small islands of Bitlik and Bitbok mark remnants of early Pleistocene post-caldera lava domes marking the volcano's latest activity. A small hot spring on Malendok Islands marks the only current thermal activity."
"Tore","154.930,-5.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111004.jpg","","A 6 x 9 km caldera at Tore volcano in the Emperor Range on NW Bougainville Island is the source of two Pleistocene ignimbrites that form a broad fan that extends the coastline to the west. The southern and SW sides of the caldera rim are covered by lava flows that extend up to 14 km from a large post-caldera lava cone. The summit of the andesitic volcano consists of an erosional pyramidal peak and a forested satellitic ash cone 3 km to the NW. The freshly preserved features of the post-caldera ash cone and lava cone indicate a Recent age (Blake and Miezitis, 1967)."
"Billy Mitchell","155.225,-6.092","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004098.jpg","","Billy Mitchell, a small pyroclastic shield immediately NE of Bagana volcano, has produced some of the largest Holocene eruptions of Papua New Guinea. Andesitic-to-dacitic Billy Mitchell volcano is truncated by a 2-km-wide caldera containing a shallow lake with a small island near its southern shore. Two major explosive eruptions, one about 900 years ago and the other about 370 years ago, produced dacitic pyroclastic-fall deposits that cover most of the northern half of Bougainville Island. The younger eruption may have been responsible for formation of the nearly vertical, steep-walled summit caldera. Pyroclastic-flow and -surge deposits from Billy Mitchell extend 25 km to the eastern coast of Bougainville Island."
"Balbi","154.980,-5.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004096.jpg","","The large Balbi stratovolcano forms the highest point on Bougainville Island. The 2715-m-high summit of the complex andesitic volcano is part of a large number of coalesced cones and lava domes. Five well-preserved craters occupy a NW-SE-trending ridge north of the summit cone, which also contains a crater. Three large valleys with steep headwalls dissect the flanks of the volcano. The age of the most recent eruption of Balbi volcano is not known precisely. An oral tradition of a major eruption during the 19th century is now thought to be in error, but could refer to minor eruptive activity from this relatively youthful-looking volcano. Fumaroles ares located within 600-m-wide Crater B and on its western flank."
"Takuan Group","155.608,-6.442","The Takuan volcano group in southern Bougainville Island consists of three closely spaced, NW-SE-trending andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes. Two of these are relatively uneroded and have probably been active during the Holocene, and a third, extensively eroded volcano is probably Pleistocene in age (Blake and Meizitis, 1967). Along with Loloru volcano, the Takuan volcanoes are post-caldera cones constructed along the rim of the Pleistocene Laluai caldera. The 2210-m NW-most volcano, Mount Takuan, is the highest of the group and is a lava cone that has fed viscous lavas flows to the south, similar to those at Bagana volcano. The central volcano contains a large lava dome in its breached summit crater; this dome may represent the most recent activity of the Takuan volcano group. Older, but still well-preserved lava flows are found on the flanks of this volcano."
"Bagana","155.196,-6.137","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/004100.jpg","","Bagana volcano, occupying a remote portion of central Bougainville Island, is one of Melanesia's youngest and most active volcanoes. This massive symmetrical, roughly 1850-m-high cone was largely constructed by an accumulation of viscous andesitic lava flows. The entire edifice could have been constructed in about 300 years at its present rate of lava production. Eruptive activity is frequent and characterized by non-explosive effusion of viscous lava that maintains a small lava dome in the summit crater, although explosive activity occasionally producing pyroclastic flows also occurs. Lava flows form dramatic, freshly preserved tongue-shaped lobes up to 50-m-thick with prominent levees that descend the volcano's flanks on all sides. Satellite thermal measurements indicate a continuous eruption from before February 2000 through at least late August 2014."
"Loloru","155.620,-6.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/005004.jpg","","Loloru, the SE-most volcano on Bougainville Island, is the source of a broad ignimbrite apron that covers much of the southern part of the island. The summit consists of two nested calderas, and a forested andesitic lava dome that restricts a crescent-shaped lake to the eastern side of the younger caldera. The smooth flanks of the pyroclastic shield are dissected by radiating deep valleys. A pristine lava flow occurs on the SE flank. Loloru is constructed within the 10 x 15 km Pleistocene Laluai caldera. The topographically higher Taroka group of volcanoes to the NW and the Takuan group to the north also were constructed within the caldera and served to deflect the bulk of Loloru ignimbrites to the south. The most recent of several major Holocene explosive eruptions at Loloru took place about 3000 years ago."
"Kana Keoki","157.030,-8.750","Bathymetry and petrologic evidence indicated the presence of an active dacitic submarine volcano SW of Rendova Island (Taylor, 1987). Kana Keoki Seamount, located along the Ghizo Ridge south of the convergent margin between the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates, rises to within about 700 m of the surface from a depth of 3700 m and is surrounded by a volcaniclastic apron."
"Coleman Seamount","157.170,-8.830","The research vessel 'Moana Wave' of the University of Hawaii discovered a young submarine volcano SE of Kana Keoki seamount during a November 1985 to January 1986 cruise. The volcano, named Coleman Seamount, was constructed over the eastern end of the inactive Woodlark spreading center, south of the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates. Coleman Seamount is undissected and probably even more recently active than Kana Keoki Seamount."
"Simbo","156.520,-8.292","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117063.jpg","","Simbo is a small island in the western Solomons with three truncated andesitic volcanic centers. The only Potassium-Argon date (2.3 +/- 1 million years ago from Mount Patukio) suggests a Pliocene-to-Pleistocene age for the island (Solomon Islands Geological Survey, 1982). The southern half of the island is thermally active. It contains fault-related fumarolic areas and hot springs near saltwater Lake Ove along the western coast and along the eastern coast near Mount Patukio, which has a steep-walled summit crater. Grover (1955) noted native accounts of the explosive enlargement of the Ngusunu explosion crater along the SW coast of the island one to two generations prior to 1955, probably after a visit by Guppy in 1882. Press reports mentioned an eruption in the early 1900s that forced the evacuation of villages beside Lake Ove, immediately adjacent to Ngusunu crater."
"Unnamed","158.030,-8.920","An E-W-trending chain of seamounts is located immediately north of Kavachi submarine volcano. The westernmost seamount, located 7 km NW of Kavachi, is the largest, and has a flat-topped summit that extended to within 70-m of the sea surface during a 1979 bathymetric survey. Its summit is covered with calcareous rocks and is fringed by a reef, but thermal plumes were detected in 1992 from one of its two summit craters. The central seamount to the east is lower and reaches to within 450 m of the sea surface. The summit of the easternmost seamount, 9-km NE of Kavachi, lies 240-m beneath the ocean surface. This unnamed andesitic seamount appears to have been formed by relatively recent eruptions."
"Gallego","159.730,-9.350","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111003.jpg","","The Pliocene-to-Quaternary Gallego volcanics, comprising a group of steeply dissected cones, cover a large area of NW Guadalcanal Island (Hackman, 1980). Mount Roundhead is a small, but well-preserved volcano. Local traditions mention an historical eruption, but this could refer to an eruption from Savo volcano (1991 pers. comm. from Coleman to R W Johnson). The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (1973) considered andesitic Mount Esperance to have been active during the past 2000 years."
"Kavachi","157.950,-9.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/016090.jpg","","Kavachi, one of the most active submarine volcanoes in the SW Pacific, occupies an isolated position in the Solomon Islands far from major aircraft and shipping lanes. Sometimes referred to as Rejo te Kvachi ('Kavachi's Oven'), it is located south of Vangunu Island only about 30 km N of the site of subduction of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Pacific plate. The shallow submarine basaltic-to-andesitic volcano has produced ephemeral islands up to 1 km long many times since its first recorded eruption during 1939. Residents of the nearby islands of Vanguna and Nggatokae (Gatokae) reported 'fire on the water' prior to 1939, a possible reference to earlier submarine eruptions. The roughly conical edifice rises from water depths of 1.1-1.2 km on the north and greater depths to the south. Frequent shallow submarine and occasional subaerial eruptions produce phreatomagmatic explosions that eject steam, ash, and incandescent bombs above the sea surface. On a number of occasions lava flows were observed on the surface of ephemeral islands."
"Savo","159.820,-9.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/105096.jpg","","The 6 x 7 km island of Savo consists of a forested andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcano with a shallow, elliptical 1 x 1.5 km wide summit crater. Lava domes of historical age are located on the crater floor and its NE rim, and older domes occur on the flanks of the volcano. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows traveled down valleys from the summit crater to form debris fans along the coast. Thermal areas located in the summit crater, the south to SE flanks, and offshore include areas of steaming ground, fumaroles, small geysers, and hot springs. Spanish explorers arrived in 1568 during the first historical eruption of Savo. Pyroclastic flows during the climactic phase killed almost all inhabitants of the island, and oral traditions also note the expansion of the island on the northern side. Other eruptive episodes occurred during the mid-17th century and during the 1830s to 1840s."
"Nonda","156.600,-7.670","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110098.jpg","","Nonda volcano, the youngest volcanic feature of Vella Lavella Island, is a lava dome located within a well-preserved crater. No historical eruptions have been reported, although inhabitants reported 'smoke' and explosive activity in the vicinity of andesitic Nonda Hill at the time of a major earthquake in 1959 (Taylor, 1976). Vella Lavella Island was mapped as several coalescing Pliocene to possibly Pleistocene volcanic centers (Solomon Islands Geological Survey, 1982). Nonda was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Fisher, 1957) based on its geothermal activity. The Paraso thermal area displays solfataras, hot springs, and boiling mud pots."
"Tinakula","165.800,-10.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104075.jpg","","The small 3.5-km-wide island of Tinakula is the exposed summit of a massive stratovolcano that rises 3-4 km from the sea floor at the NW end of the Santa Cruz islands. Tinakula resembles Stromboli volcano in containing a breached summit crater that extends from the 851-m-high summit to below sea level. Landslides enlarged this scarp in 1965, creating an embayment on the NW coast. The satellitic cone of Mendana is located on the SE side. The dominantly andesitic Tinakula volcano has frequently been observed in eruption since the era of Spanish exploration began in 1595. In about 1840, an explosive eruption apparently produced pyroclastic flows that swept all sides of the island, killing its inhabitants. Frequent historical eruptions have originated from a cone constructed within the large breached crater. These have left the upper flanks of the volcano and the steep apron of lava flows and volcaniclastic debris within the breach unvegetated."
"Motlav","167.670,-13.670","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111011.jpg","","The elongated island of Motlav, also referred to as Mota Lava, is comprised of at least five Pleistocene basaltic stratovolcanoes capped by two well-preserved late-Pleistocene to Holocene pyroclastic cones, Tuntog and Vetnam. Tuntog is a largely pyroclastic composite cone at the SW end of the island with a 500-m-wide summit crater. Vetman, in the center of the island, is a pyroclastic cone truncated by a summit crater that is breached on the southern side. The 411-m high point of Motlav is a remnant of older volcanics along the central ridge of the 12-km-long, NE-SW-trending island."
"Suretamatai","167.470,-13.800","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111012.jpg","","Suretamatai volcano forms much of Vanua Lava Island, one of the largest of Vanuatu's Banks Islands. The younger lavas of 921-m-high Suretamatai (also known as Soritimeat) volcano overlie a number of small older stratovolcanoes that form the island. In contrast to other large volcanoes of Vanuatu, the dominantly basaltic-to-andesitic Suretamatai does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE-SSW line, gives the low-angle volcano an irregular profile. The youngest cone, near the northern end of the chain, is the largest and contains a lake of variable depth within its 900-m-wide, 100-m-deep summit crater. Historical activity, beginning during the 19th century, has been restricted to moderate explosive eruptions."
"Mere Lava","168.050,-14.450","The small 4-km-wide symmetrical island of basaltic Mera Lava in the southern Banks Islands contains a well-preserved summit crater and an east-west line of young cinder cones cutting across the NE flank. Several small cinder cones occupy the triangular summit crater of 1028-m-high Star Peak, the high point of the island. The low degree of dissection indicates that Mera Lava was in eruption during the Holocene (Mallick and Ash, 1975). Mere Lava was reported to have been smoking when it was first seen by the explorer Queiros in 1606."
"Gaua","167.500,-14.270","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085033.jpg","","The roughly 20-km-diameter Gaua Island, also known as Santa Maria, consists of a basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcano with an 6 x 9 km wide summit caldera. Small parasitic vents near the caldera rim fed Pleistocene lava flows that reached the coast on several sides of the island; several littoral cones were formed where these lava flows reached the sea. Quiet collapse that formed the roughly 700-m-deep caldera was followed by extensive ash eruptions. Construction of the historically active cone of Mount Garat (Gharat) and other small cinder cones in the SW part of the caldera has left a crescent-shaped caldera lake. The symmetrical, flat-topped Mount Garat cone is topped by three pit craters. The onset of eruptive activity from a vent high on the SE flank in 1962 ended a long period of dormancy."
"Aoba","167.830,-15.400","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119011.jpg","","Aoba, also known as Ambae, is a massive 2500 cu km basaltic shield volcano that is the most voluminous volcano of the New Hebrides archipelago. A pronounced NE-SW-trending rift zone dotted with scoria cones gives the 16 x 38 km island an elongated form. A broad pyroclastic cone containing three crater lakes is located at the summit of the Hawaiian-style shield volcano within the youngest of at least two nested calderas, the largest of which is 6 km in diameter. Post-caldera explosive eruptions formed the summit craters of Lake Voui (also spelled Vui) and Lake Manaro Ngoru about 360 years ago. A tuff cone was constructed within Lake Voui about 60 years later. The latest known flank eruption, about 300 years ago, destroyed the population of the Nduindui area near the western coast."
"Ambrym","168.120,-16.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119013.jpg","","Ambrym, a large basaltic volcano with a 12-km-wide caldera, is one of the most active volcanoes of the New Hebrides arc. A thick, almost exclusively pyroclastic sequence, initially dacitic, then basaltic, overlies lava flows of a pre-caldera shield volcano. The caldera was formed during a major plinian eruption with dacitic pyroclastic flows about 1900 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions, primarily from Marum and Benbow cones, have partially filled the caldera floor and produced lava flows that ponded on the caldera floor or overflowed through gaps in the caldera rim. Post-caldera eruptions have also formed a series of scoria cones and maars along a fissure system oriented ENE-WSW. Eruptions have apparently occurred almost yearly during historical time from cones within the caldera or from flank vents. However, from 1850 to 1950, reporting was mostly limited to extra-caldera eruptions that would have affected local populations."
"Lopevi","168.346,-16.507","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119014.jpg","","The small 7-km-wide conical island of Lopevi, known locally as Vanei Vollohulu, is one of Vanuatu's most active volcanoes. A small summit crater containing a cinder cone is breached to the NW and tops an older cone that is rimmed by the remnant of a larger crater. The basaltic-to-andesitic volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, primarily along a NW-SE-trending fissure that cuts across the island, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the coast. Historical eruptions at the 1413-m-high volcano date back to the mid-19th century. The island was evacuated following major eruptions in 1939 and 1960. The latter eruption, from a NW-flank fissure vent, produced a pyroclastic flow that swept to the sea and a lava flow that formed a new peninsula on the western coast."
"Epi","168.370,-16.680","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110036.jpg","","A large caldera, with submarine post-caldera cones active in historical time, lies off the eastern coast of Epi Island. Epi Island itself, located slightly west of the main New Hebrides volcanic arc, largely consists of two Quaternary volcanoes, Mount Allombei on the west and Pomare (Tavani Kutali) on the east. Tavani Ruro, which forms an elongated eastern extension of Epi Island across a narrow isthmus, is related to Kuwae caldera to the east. Pomare volcano is the highest point on the island and has three well-preserved subsidiary cones to the east with youthful summit craters. Pomare volcano is truncated on its eastern side by the largely submarine East Epi caldera, which has been the source of all historical eruptions. Three small submarine basaltic and dacitic cones, known as Epi A, Epi B, and Epi C, are located along the northern rim of the breached caldera. Ephemeral islands were formed during eruptions in 1920 and 1953, and the summit of the shallowest cone, Epi B, was at 34 m below sea level at the time of a 2001 survey."
"Kuwae","168.536,-16.829","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119010.jpg","","The largely submarine Kuwae caldera occupies the area between Epi and Tongoa islands. The 6 x 12 km caldera contains two basins that cut the NW end of Tongoa Island and the flank of the late-Pleistocene or Holocene Tavani Ruru volcano on the SE tip of Epi Island. Native legends and radiocarbon dates from pyroclastic-flow deposits have been correlated with a 1452 CE ice-core peak thought to be associated with collapse of Kuwae caldera; however, others considered the deposits to be of smaller-scale eruptions and the ice-core peak to be associated with another unknown major South Pacific eruption. The submarine volcano Karua lies near the northern rim of Kuwae caldera and is one of the most active volcanoes of Vanuatu. It has formed several ephemeral islands since it was first observed in eruption during 1897."
"Unnamed","168.592,-16.992","A group of small islands south of Tongoa Island were considered to be remnants of a once-larger landmass that foundered during the Holocene. Ewose, Buninga, and Tongariki islands, at the southern end of the Shepherd Islands, lie on the rim of a proposed caldera thought to be one of several formed in the central volcanic chain of Vanuatu about 2000 years ago (Crawford et al. 1988, Macfarlane et al. 1988). Eissen et al. (1991) did not find evidence for a caldera at this location. Pyroclastic rocks intruded by dikes are exposed on Ewose, whereas Buninga and Makura are largely composed of tilted lava flows. Tongariki consists of remnants of a basaltic stratovolcano with dacitic pumiceous tuffs in low-lying areas."
"North Vate","168.353,-17.470","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119012.jpg","","The islands of Nguna, Pele, and Emau, north of Vate Island (also known as Efaté), have been variously mapped as Pleistocene and Pleistocene to Holocene. Late-Pleistocene to Holocene eruptions constructed composite basaltic cones with well-preserved craters. Largely submarine calderas north of Vate Island of varying sizes have been inferred, ranging from a large caldera whose southern rim is defined by the islands of Nguna, Pele, and Emao to a smaller caldera, but their submarine morphology is difficult to define. Pumiceous deposits of the Efaté Pumice Formation cover much of Vate (Efaté) Island and record a major trachydacitic explosive eruption about 1 million years ago that originated from a submarine vent somewhere north of the island."
"Traitor's Head","169.230,-18.750","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104077.jpg","","The Traitor's Head Peninsula north of Cook Bay on eastern Erromango Island is comprised of three Holocene volcanic cones that are the youngest on the 50-km-long island. Mounts Rantop, Nagat, and Oulenou are small basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcanoes with well-preserved morphologies. Mount Rantop is the largest, rising to 837 m, and 421-m-high Mount Oulenou is the most youthful looking, with an unbreached crater. A low plateau to the NW is underlain by ash deposits distributed by southeasterly trade winds. The volcanoes initially formed an offshore island that was joined to the mainland by uplift after volcanism ceased. A submarine vent offshore between the tip of the peninsula and Goat Island, 5 km to the NE, erupted in 1881, the only historical activity of the Erromango volcanoes."
"Yasur","169.442,-19.530","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/016098.jpg","","Yasur, the best-known and most frequently visited of the Vanuatu volcanoes, has been in more-or-less continuous strombolian and vulcanian activity since Captain Cook observed ash eruptions in 1774. This style of activity may have continued for the past 800 years. Yasur, located at the SE tip of Tanna Island, is a mostly unvegetated 361-m-high pyroclastic cone with a nearly circular, 400-m-wide summit crater. Yasur is largely contained within the small Yenkahe caldera and is the youngest of a group of Holocene volcanic centers constructed over the down-dropped NE flank of the Pleistocene Tukosmeru volcano. The Yenkahe horst is located within the Siwi ring fracture, a 4-km-wide, horseshoe-shaped caldera associated with eruption of the andesitic Siwi pyroclastic sequence. Active tectonism along the Yenkahe horst accompanying eruptions of Yasur has raised Port Resolution harbor more than 20 m during the past century."
"Aneityum","169.780,-20.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111013.jpg","","Oval-shaped, 17-km-wide Aneityum Island, also known as Anatom or Anetchom, lies SE of Tanna Island and is the southernmost of the Vanuatu Islands chain. Aneityum consists of two coalescing, dominantly basaltic Pleistocene volcanoes. Both the NW side of Inrerow Atamwan volcano and the SE side of Nanawarez volcano are truncated by large erosional cirques. Volcanic activity ceased during the uppermost late-Pleistocene to Holocene (Carney and Macfarlane, 1979)."
"Eastern Gemini Seamount","170.280,-20.980","A submarine eruption, the first recorded in historical time from this previously little known seamount, was observed by a passing ship on February 18, 1996. Water discoloration and bursts of very dark water were observed at Eastern Gemini. Overflights as late as the 22nd noted periodic explosions that ejected black products to about 20 m above sea level. Located ~100 km south of Aneityum Island, about halfway between Yasur volcano and Matthew Island, the Eastern Gemini seamount, also known as Oscostar, is one of several seamounts along the southern submarine extension of the New Hebrides island arc. It consists of an elongated NNE-SSW-trending ridge of submarine volcanoes with satellitic cones. Several basaltic samples and one andesitic rock dredged from this seamount in 1989 were described as glassy, vesicular, and extremely fresh."
"Matthew Island","171.320,-22.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017003.jpg","","Isolated Matthew Island is composed of two low andesitic-to-dacitic cones separated by a narrow isthmus. Matthew Island was discovered in 1788 by a ship captain, who named the island after the owner of his vessel. Only the triangular eastern portion of the small, 0.6 x 1.2 km wide island was present prior to the 1940s, when construction of the larger western segment began; it consists primarily of lava flows. The 177-m-high western cone contains a crater that is breached to the NW and is filled by a lava flow whose terminus forms the NW coast."
"Hunter Island","172.050,-22.400","Hunter Island, the SE-most volcano of the New Hebrides arc, is a small 1-km-wide island consisting of a composite andesitic-to-dacitic cone topped by explosion craters and a lava dome. The island was named after the vessel that discovered it in 1798. A 100-m-deep, steep-sided crater occupies the NW part of the island, which contrasts with the southern cone, whose summit is filled by a lava dome. Several poorly documented eruptions have been noted since the 19th century. Large streams of lava were reported to be pouring from two craters on the eastern side of the island in 1895; the latest eruption apparently took place from the northern tip of the island. Fumarolic and solfataric areas are located at the northern tip of the island and the NE and SE coasts."
"North Norfolk Plateau","168.630,-25.780","A hydrophone signal was detected in 1963 from a submarine eruption near the Norfolk Island Ridge in the SW Pacific about 450 km SSE of New Caledonia. A ship shortly thereafter observed large amounts of floating pumice from an area consistent with the hydrophone signal source. The Norfolk Island Ridge rises at least 1100 m from a typical basin depth of 3500 m in this area. The location listed here is that of the floating pumice observation. Pumice has been also been observed previously at this location (Kibblewhite, 1966)."
"Newer Volcanics Province","142.500,-37.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/097017.jpg","","The voluminous Newer Volcanics province covers a broad 15,000 sq km area of SE Australia with nearly 400 small shield volcanoes and explosive vents of Tertiary-to-Holocene age. Volumetrically the vast proportion of volcanic products consist of flat-lying lava flows, although the most prominent features of the volcanic field are the numerous small scoria cones, tuff rings, and maars that rise above the lava plain. Several vents were active during the Holocene; another vent (Mount Tower) is now considered to be of late-Pleistocene age. Late-Pleistocene to Holocene eruptions are characterized by small volume and low explosivity, forming a series of scoria cones, maars, tuff rings, and major valley filling lava flows. The youngest dated eruptions took place at Mount Schank and Mount Gambier about 5000 years ago, when explosive activity formed several maars and associated lava flows."
"Narcondum","94.280,13.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/098077.jpg","","Narcondum volcano, an island possession of India in the Andaman Sea, is part of a volcanic arc that continues northward from Sumatra to Burma (Myanmar). The small 3 x 4 km wide conical island, located about 130 km east of North Andaman Island, rises to 710 m, but its base lies an additional 1000 m beneath the sea. The island is densely vegetated, bounded by cliffs on the southern side, and capped by three peaks. No evidence of historical volcanism is present, although the summit region is less densely vegetated. Volcanism at the andesitic volcano is considered to have continued into the Holocene (Krishnan, 1957). The island's name means 'pit of hell,' although the name could have been mistakenly transferred from the historically active Barren Island volcano, 140 km to the SSW."
"Barren Island","93.858,12.278","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017006.jpg","","Barren Island, a possession of India in the Andaman Sea about 135 km NE of Port Blair in the Andaman Islands, is the only historically active volcano along the N-S-trending volcanic arc extending between Sumatra and Burma (Myanmar). The 354-m-high island is the emergent summit of a volcano that rises from a depth of about 2250 m. The small, uninhabited 3-km-wide island contains a roughly 2-km-wide caldera with walls 250-350 m high. The caldera, which is open to the sea on the west, was created during a major explosive eruption in the late Pleistocene that produced pyroclastic-flow and -surge deposits. Historical eruptions have changed the morphology of the pyroclastic cone in the center of the caldera, and lava flows that fill much of the caldera floor have reached the sea along the western coast."
"Seulawah Agam","95.658,5.448","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119084.jpg","","Seulawah Agam at the NW tip of Sumatra is an extensively forested volcano of Pleistocene-Holocene age constructed within the large Pleistocene Lam Teuba caldera. A smaller 8 x 6 km caldera lies within Lam Teuba caldera. The summit contains a forested, 400-m-wide crater. The active van Heutsz crater, located at 650 m on the NNE flank of Suelawah Agam, is one of several areas containing active fumarole fields. Sapper (1927) and the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (CAVW) reported an explosive eruption in the early 16th century, and the CAVW also listed an eruption from the van Heutsz crater in 1839. Rock et al. (1982) found no evidence for historical eruptions. However the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia noted that although no historical eruptions have occurred from the main cone, the reported NNE-flank explosive activity may have been hydrothermal and not have involved new magmatic activity."
"Peuet Sague","96.329,4.914","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119080.jpg","","Peuet Sague is a large volcanic complex that rises to 2801 m in NW Sumatra. The volcano, whose name means 'square,' contains four summit peaks, with the youngest lava dome being located to the north or NW. This extremely isolated volcano lies several days journey on foot from the nearest village and is infrequently visited. The first recorded historical eruption took place from 1918-21, when explosive activity and pyroclastic flows accompanied summit lava-dome growth. The historically active crater is located SE of the Gunung Tutung lava dome and has typically produced small-to-moderate explosive eruptions."
"Telong, Bur ni","96.821,4.769","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120019.jpg","","The conical Bur ni Telong volcano was constructed at the southern base of the massive Bur ni Geureudong volcanic complex, one of the largest in northern Sumatra. The historically active Bur ni Telong volcano lies 4.5 km from the summit of Geureudong and grew to a height of 2624 m. The summit crater of Bur ni Telong has migrated to the ESE, leaving arcuate crater rims. Lava flows are exposed on the southern flank. Explosive eruptions were recorded during the 19th and 20th centuries."
"Singkut","98.501,3.248","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/005022.jpg","","The Quaternary Singkut caldera is about 9 km in diameter, with the SW half of the rim topographically distinct. Post-caldera cones are located near the south rim, including Sibayak, Pintau, and Pratektekan. Sibayak and Pintau are twin volcanoes within a small compound caldera open to the north. The 900-m-wide Sibayak crater is partially filled on the north by Pintau. A lava flow traveled through a gap in the western crater wall from the summit lava dome of Sibayak; the active geothermal field SE of the summit has abundant solfataras and fumaroles. Area residents record legends of eruptions. Neumann van Padang (1983) cited a report by Hoekstra of ash clouds that were emitted from the volcano in 1881. The town of Berastagi is situated within the larger Singkut caldera immediately SE of the younger cones."

The migration of summit vents along a N-S line gives the summit crater complex an elongated form. The youngest crater of this conical, 2460-m-high andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is at the southern end of the four overlapping summit craters. An unconfirmed eruption was noted in 1881, and solfataric activity was seen at the summit and upper flanks in 1912. No confirmed historical eruptions were recorded prior to explosive eruptions during August-September 2010 that produced ash plumes to 5 km above the summit."
"Toba","98.830,2.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114091.jpg","","The 35 x 100 km Toba caldera, the Earth's largest Quaternary caldera, was formed during four major Pleistocene ignimbrite-producing eruptions beginning at 1.2 million years ago. The latest of these produced the Young Toba Tuff (YTT) about 74,000 years ago. The YTT represents the world's largest known Quaternary eruption, ejecting about 2500-3000 cu km (dense rock equivalent) of ignimbrite and airfall ash from vents at the NW and SE ends of present-day Lake Toba. Resurgent doming forming the massive Samosir Island and Uluan Peninsula structural blocks postdated eruption of the YTT. Additional post-YTT eruptions include emplacement of a series of lava domes, growth of the solfatarically active Pusukbukit volcano on the south margin of the caldera, and formation of Tandukbenua volcano at the NW-most rim of the caldera. Lack of vegetation suggests that this volcano may be only a few hundred years old (Chesner and Rose, 1991)."

Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan.

The 1346-m-high basaltic-to-andesitic Pulosari volcano lies across a low saddle from the higher Karang volcano, which was constructed on the SE rim of Danau caldera."
"Karang","106.042,-6.270","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114026.jpg","","Gunung Karang volcano in westernmost Java was constructed SE of the 15-km-wide Pleistocene Danau caldera. Two craters, Kawah Welirang and Kawah Haji, display fumarolic activity and are found on the eastern flanks of 1778-m-high Karang volcano, which may be of Holocene age (Bronto 1995, pers. comm.). The forested andesitic and basaltic volcano is the highest of a group of stratovolcanoes in the Danau caldera area and lies across a low saddle from Pulosari volcano."
"Perbakti-Gagak","106.700,-6.750","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045016.jpg","","The Perbakti-Gagak volcanic complex, also known as Kiaraberes-Gagak, is a cluster of deeply eroded stratovolcanoes situated immediately SW of Salak volcano. The 1699-m-high summit ridge of Gunung Perbakti is elongated in a NW-SE direction, and Gunung Endut volcano rises to 1474 m above a saddle SW of Perbakti. Gunung Gagak lies to the NW; it is capped by pumice and obsidian, and obsidian lava flows extend to the north and NE. Quaternary rhyolitic lava domes form a NNE-trending chain at the eastern side of the complex. Two 2-km-wide depressions on the northern and southern sides of Perbakti form the headwaters of the Kaluwung Herang and Pamatutan rivers, respectively. The volcanic complex is marked by vigorous geothermal activity. Fumaroles, mud pots and hot springs are located on the south and SE flanks of Perbakti and at the Kiaraberes area, which includes the commercial geothermal field of Awibengkok. Mild phreatic eruptions took place during the Holocene into historical time from flank fumarolic fields."
"Salak","106.730,-6.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120031.jpg","","Salak volcano was constructed at the NE end of an eroded volcanic range. Satellitic cones occur on the SW flank and at the northern foot of the forested volcano. Two large breached craters truncate the summit of Gunung Salak. One crater is breached to the NE and the westernmost crater was the source of a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 10 km WNW of the summit. Historical eruptions from Gunung Salak have been restricted to phreatic explosions from craters in a prominent solfataric area at 1400 m on the western flank. Salak volcano has been the site of extensive geothermal exploration."
"Gede-Pangrango","106.965,-6.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120032.jpg","","Gede volcano is one of the most prominent in western Java, forming a twin volcano with Pangrango volcano to the NW. The major cities of Cianjur, Sukabumi, and Bogor are situated below the volcanic complex to the E, S, and NW, respectively. Gunung Pangrango, constructed over the NE rim of a 3 x 5 km caldera, forms the high point of the complex at just over 3000 m elevation. Many lava flows are visible on the flanks of the younger Gunung Gede, including some that may have been erupted in historical time. The steep-walled summit crater has migrated about 1 km NNW over time. Two large debris-avalanche deposits on its flanks, one of which underlies the city of Cianjur, record previous large-scale collapses. Historical activity, recorded since the 16th century, typically consists of small explosive eruptions of short duration."
"Patuha","107.400,-7.160","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/063077.jpg","","The forested twin volcano Gunung Patuha rises SW of the plain of Bandung. The andesitic volcano contains two summit craters 600 m apart along a NW-SE line. The NW-most and highest summit crater is dry, but the SE crater, Kawah Putih, contains a shallow greenish-white crater lake. Kawah Putih is mined for sulfur. A large debris-avalanche deposit produced by collapse of the volcano extends to the NE. The volcano was formed during the late Pleistocene, but has a youthful morphology. No historical eruptions are known from Patuha."
"Malabar","107.650,-7.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117010.jpg","","The forested Gunung Malabar stratovolcano, located immediately south of the city of Bandung, is of possible Holocene age (Bronto 1995, pers. comm.).

Gunung Wayang, with a 750-m-wide crescentic crater open to the west, contains four groups of fumaroles. Gunung Windu, 1.6 to the SW, has a 350-m-wide crater open to the ESE. The age of the latest eruptive activity from Wayang-Windu is not known."
"Tangkubanparahu","107.600,-6.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/005099.jpg","","Tangkubanparahu (also known as Tangkuban Perahu) is a broad shield-like stratovolcano overlooking Indonesia's former capital city of Bandung. The volcano was constructed within the 6 x 8 km Pleistocene Sunda caldera, which formed about 190,000 years ago. The volcano's low profile is the subject of legends referring to the mountain of the 'upturned boat.' The rim of Sunda caldera forms a prominent ridge on the western side; elsewhere the caldera rim is largely buried by deposits of Tangkubanparahu volcano. The dominantly small phreatic historical eruptions recorded since the 19th century have originated from several nested craters within an elliptical 1 x 1.5 km summit depression."
"Papandayan","107.730,-7.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010043.jpg","","Papandayan is a complex stratovolcano with four large summit craters, the youngest of which was breached to the NE by collapse during a brief eruption in 1772 and contains active fumarole fields. The broad 1.1-km-wide, flat-floored Alun-Alun crater truncates the summit of Papandayan, and Gunung Puntang to the north gives the volcano a twin-peaked appearance. Several episodes of collapse have given the volcano an irregular profile and produced debris avalanches that have impacted lowland areas beyond the volcano. A sulfur-encrusted fumarole field occupies historically active Kawah Mas ('Golden Crater'). After its first historical eruption in 1772, in which collapse of the NE flank produced a catastrophic debris avalanche that destroyed 40 villages and killed nearly 3000 persons, only small phreatic eruptions had occurred prior to an explosive eruption that began in November 2002."
"Kendang","107.709,-7.245","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117011.jpg","","The Quaternary Gunung Kendang volcano (also spelled Kendeng) is located immediately north of Papandayan volcano. Kendang contains four fumarole fields, the most prominent of which is Kawah Manuk, located in a broad 2.75-km-wide crater-like depression. Thermal activity consists of fumaroles with sulfur sublimation, mud pots, and hot water pools with occasional mild water ejections. The Darajat geothermal field is located on the E flank and along the Kendang fault, which extends NE to the Kawah Kamojang geothermal field. The latest eruptions produced the very young Kiamis rhyolitic lava dome and obsidian lava flows. Gunung Kiamis was labeled as Recent on a map of Whittome and Salveson (1990) and is located 2 km NE of the Darajat geothermal field."
"Tampomas","107.950,-6.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045022.jpg","","Gunung Tampomas, the northernmost young volcano in western Java, is a small andesitic stratovolcano overlooking the northern coastal plain about halfway between Tangkubanparahu and Cereme volcanoes. Youthful-looking lava flows are found on the flanks of Tampomas volcano."
"Guntur","107.840,-7.143","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010057.jpg","","Guntur is a complex of several overlapping stratovolcanoes about 10 km NW of the city of Garut in western Java. Young lava flows, the most recent of which was erupted in 1840, are visible on the flanks of the erosionally unmodified Gunung Guntur, which rises about 1550 m above the plain of Garut. It is one of a group of younger cones constructed to the SW of an older eroded group of volcanoes at the NE end of the complex. Guntur, whose name means 'thunder,' is the only historically active center, with eruptions having been recorded since the late-17th century. Although it has produced frequent explosive eruptions in the 19th century, making it one of the most active volcanoes of western Java, it has not erupted since."
"Galunggung","108.058,-7.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010061.jpg","","The forested slopes of 2168-m-high Galunggung volcano in western Java are cut by a large horseshoe-shaped caldera breached to the SE that has served to channel the products of recent eruptions in that direction. The 'Ten Thousand Hills of Tasikmalaya' dotting the plain below the volcano are debris-avalanche hummocks from the collapse that formed the breached caldera about 4200 years ago. Although historical eruptions, restricted to the central vent near the caldera headwall, have been infrequent, they have caused much devastation. The first historical eruption in 1822 produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that killed over 4000 persons. More recently, a strong explosive eruption during 1982-1983 caused severe economic disruption to populated areas near the volcano."
"Talagabodas","108.070,-7.208","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100068.jpg","","The Gunung Talagabodas stratovolcano lies immediately north of the more well-known Galunggung volcano. Talagabodas, also spelled Telaga Bodas, is one of the older Quaternary volcanoes in an arcuate N-S trending volcano group east of the city of Garut and is built up of andesitic lavas and pyroclastics. Younger pyroclastics from Gunung Putri-Eweranda overlap the Talagabodas products in the north. The crater of Talagabodas has shifted 1.3 km north from the summit crater of Canar and contains a large sulfur-saturated lake. Fumaroles, mud pots, and a warm spring are found around the lake, which has an elevated temperature. The age of the most recent eruption is not known. Changes in lake color occurred in 1913 and 1921, and expanded solfataric activity was reported in 1927. Suffocating gases have frequently killed animals that have wandered into the Pajagalan valley on the NE flank and the Kawah Saat geothermal area south of the crater lake. The Kawah Karaha fumaroles 9 km N are also part of the geothermal system (Tripp et al., 2002)."
"Cereme","108.400,-6.892","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120020.jpg","","The symmetrical stratovolcano Cereme, also known as Ciremai, is located closer to the northern coast than other central Java volcanoes. A steep-sided double crater elongated in an E-W direction caps 3078-m-high Gunung Cereme, which was constructed on the northern rim of the 4.5 x 5 km Geger Halang caldera. A large landslide deposit to the north may be associated with the origin of the caldera, although collapse may rather be due to a voluminous explosive eruption (Newhall and Dzurisin, 1988). Eruptions, relatively infrequent in historical time, have included explosive activity and lahars, primarily from the summit crater."
"Slamet","109.208,-7.242","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/063023.jpg","","Slamet, Java's second highest volcano at 3428 m and one of its most active, has a cluster of about three dozen cinder cones on its lower SE-NE flanks and a single cinder cone on the western flank. It is composed of two overlapping edifices, an older basaltic-andesite to andesitic volcano on the west and a younger basaltic to basaltic-andesite one on the east. Gunung Malang II cinder cone on the upper E flank on the younger edifice fed a lava flow that extends 6 km E. Four craters occur at the summit of Gunung Slamet, with activity migrating to the SW over time. Historical eruptions, recorded since the 18th century, have originated from a 150-m-deep, 450-m-wide, steep-walled crater at the western part of the summit and have consisted of explosive eruptions generally lasting a few days to a few weeks."
"Dieng Volcanic Complex","109.920,-7.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010074.jpg","","The Dieng plateau in the highlands of central Java is renowned both for the variety of its volcanic scenery and as a sacred area housing Java's oldest Hindu temples, dating back to the 9th century CE. The Dieng volcanic complex consists of two or more stratovolcanoes and more than 20 small craters and cones of Pleistocene-to-Holocene age over a 6 x 14 km area. Prahu stratovolcano was truncated by a large Pleistocene caldera, which was subsequently filled by a series of dissected to youthful cones, lava domes, and craters, many containing lakes. Lava flows cover much of the plateau, but have not occurred in historical time, when activity has been restricted to minor phreatic eruptions. Toxic volcanic gas emission has caused fatalities and is a hazard at several craters. The abundant thermal features that dot the plateau and high heat flow make Dieng a major geothermal prospect."
"Sundoro","109.992,-7.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010077.jpg","","Gunung Sundoro, one Java's most symmetrical volcanoes, is separated by a 1400-m-high saddle from Sumbing volcano. Parasitic craters and cones, the largest of which is Kembang, occur on the NW-to-southern flanks, and all fed lava flows. A small lava dome occupies the summit crater of the 3136-m-high volcano, and numerous phreatic explosion vents were formed along radial fissure that cut the dome and extend across the crater rim. Lava flows extend in all directions from the summit crater. Deposits of a large prehistoric debris avalanche are located below the NE flank of Sundoro. Pyroclastic-flow deposits dated at 1720 years before present extend as far as 13 km from the summit. Historical eruptions typically have consisted of mild-to-moderate phreatic explosions, mostly from the summit crater. Flank vents were also active in 1882 and 1903."
"Sumbing","110.070,-7.384","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010082.jpg","","Gunung Sumbing is a prominent 3371-m-high stratovolcano that lies across a 1400-m-high saddle from symmetrical Sundoro volcano in central Java. Prominent flank cones are located on the north and SE sides of Sumbing, which is somewhat more dissected than Sundoro volcano. An 800-m-wide horseshoe-shaped summit crater breached to the NE is partially filled by a lava dome that fed a lava flow down to 2400 m altitude. Emplacement of the dome followed the eruption of extensive pyroclastic flows down the NE flank. The only report of historical activity, in about 1730 CE, may have produced the small phreatic craters found at the summit."
"Telomoyo","110.400,-7.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/086086.jpg","","Telomoyo volcano, also spelled Telemojo, was constructed over the southern flank of the eroded Pleistocene Soropati volcano and is in part of Holocene age (van Bemmelen 1941). It lies along a NNW-SSE-trending line of volcanoes extending from Ungaran in the north to Merapi in the south. The eastern flank of Soropati volcano collapsed during the Pleistocene, leaving a U-shaped depression. Telomoyo subsequently filled much of the southern side of this depression and grew to a height of 600 m above its rim."
"Ungaran","110.330,-7.180","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045028.jpg","","Gunung Ungaran volcano, south of the northern coastal city of Semarang, lies at the northern end of a transverse chain of Java volcanoes extending NNW from Merapi. Ungaran was formed in three stages, with growth of the youngest edifice taking place during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The youngest Ungaran edifice was constructed south of three large remnant structural blocks of the 2nd Ungaran volcano. A group of pyroclastic cones was also constructed along the margins of the older volcano. Ungaran is deeply eroded and no historical eruptions have been reported, but two active fumarole fields are located on the volcano's flanks."
"Merbabu","110.430,-7.450","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/011012.jpg","","Gunung Merbabu is a massive forested volcano that rises to the north above a broad 1500-m-high saddle from the renowned Merapi volcano in central Java. The volcano is elongated in a NNW-SSE direction, parallel to the trend of the long transverse volcanic chain extending from Merapi to Ungaran volcano. Three prominent U-shaped radial valleys extend from the 3145-m-high summit of Merbabu toward the NW, NE, and SE, dividing the volcano into three segments. The most recent magmatic eruptions originated from a NNW-SSE fissure system that cut across the summit and fed the large-volume Kopeng and Kajor lava flows on the northern and southern flanks, respectively. Moderate explosive eruptions have occurred from the summit crater of Merbabu in historical time."
"Muria","110.880,-6.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115010.jpg","","Muria stratovolcano forms the broad Muria Peninsula along the northern coast of central Java and lies well north of the main volcanic chain. This 1625-m-high volcano occupies much of the peninsula and is flanked by Genuk volcano, an eroded lava-dome complex near the coast at the northern base of Muria. Muria (also spelled Muriah) is largely Pleistocene in age and displays deeply eroded flanks. The summit of the high-potassium volcano is cut by several large N-S-trending craters, some containing lava domes. Numerous flank vents include lava domes, cinder cones, and maars. The most recent eruptive activity at Muria produced three maars on the SE and NE flanks and a lava flow from a SE-flank vent that entered one of the maars. Conflicting late-Pleistocene to Holocene age dates for these maars leave uncertainties about their ages, but their youthful morphology in surrounding eroded terrain suggests a probable Holocene age, and they could be as young as several thousand years."
"Merapi","110.442,-7.542","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017022.jpg","","Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas and dominates the landscape immediately north of the major city of Yogyakarta. It is the youngest and southernmost of a volcanic chain extending NNW to Ungaran volcano. Growth of Old Merapi volcano during the Pleistocene ended with major edifice collapse perhaps about 2000 years ago, leaving a large arcuate scarp cutting the eroded older Batulawang volcano. Subsequently growth of the steep-sided Young Merapi edifice, its upper part unvegetated due to frequent eruptive activity, began SW of the earlier collapse scarp. Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanying growth and collapse of the steep-sided active summit lava dome have devastated cultivated lands on the western-to-southern flanks and caused many fatalities during historical time."
"Lawu","111.192,-7.625","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/011014.jpg","","The massive compound stratovolcano Lawu contains an older, deeply eroded volcano on the north separated by a crescentic rift valley from the younger Lawu volcano of Holocene age (van Bemmelen, 1949b). Parasitic crater lakes and pyroclastic cones are found at the eastern side of the rift. The younger Lawu volcano contains eroded crater rims; its latest activity, including construction of a lava dome, occurred at the south end. A fumarolic area is located on the south flank at 2550 m. The only reported historical eruption from Lawu took place in 1885, when rumblings and light ashfall were reported. A major eruption reported from Lawu in 1752 was from neighboring Kelut volcano."
"Wilis","111.758,-7.808","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/093056.jpg","","Gunung Wilis is a solitary volcanic massif surrounded by low-elevation plains on all but its southern side. It was formed during three episodes dating back to the mid Pleistocene. Following destruction of the 2nd edifice, the most recent cone grew during the Holocene. No confirmed historical eruptions are known, although there was a report of an eruption in 1641 CE, the same year as a major eruption of nearby Kelut. Fumaroles and mud pots occur near Lake Ngebel on the lower western flank."
"Kawi-Butak","112.450,-7.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/092065.jpg","","The broad Kawi-Butak volcanic massif lies immediately east of Kelut volcano and south of Arjuno-Welirang volcano.

A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the eastern, western, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded from Gunung Kelut since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an ambitious engineering project sought to drain the crater lake. This initial effort lowered the lake by more than 50 m, but the 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after repair of the damaged drainage tunnels. After more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters."
"Penanggungan","112.630,-7.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/064080.jpg","","Gunung Penanggungan, one of Java's most revered mountains, is a small stratovolcano constructed immediately north of the Arjuno-Welirang massif. Numerous ruins of sanctuaries, monuments, and sacred bathing places dating from 977-1511 CE are found on the northern and western flanks. Lava flows from flank vents descend all sides of the 1653-m-high volcano and pyroclastic-flow deposits form an apron around it. Penanggungan was mapped as similar in age to Arjuno-Welirang and Semeru volcanoes by van Bemmelen (1937). Penanggungan was considered to be extinct for at least 1000 years. Its last eruption may have occurred about 200 CE."
"Malang Plain","112.680,-8.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117009.jpg","","A group of nine ash cones, maars, and volcanic plugs of subrecent-to-recent (Holocene) age are found on the Malang Plain, SE and NE of the city of Malang (van Bemmelen, 1937). Some of these may be partly parasitic to Tengger Caldera, although others have no clear connection to any specific eruption center and are situated on a distinct N-S zone of tectonic weakness."
"Arjuno-Welirang","112.580,-7.725","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045031.jpg","","The twin volcanoes of Arjuno and Welirang anchor the SE and NW ends, respectively, of a 6-km-long line of volcanic cones and craters. The Arjuno-Welirang complex overlies two older volcanoes, Gunung Ringgit to the east and Gunung Linting to the south. The summit areas of both volcanoes are unvegetated. Additional pyroclastic cones are located on the north flank of Gunung Welirang and along an E-W-trending line cutting across the southern side of Gunung Arjuno that extends to the lower SE flank. Fumarolic areas with sulfur deposition occur at several locations on Gunung Welirang."
"Semeru","112.920,-8.108","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/007036.jpg","","Semeru, the highest volcano on Java, and one of its most active, lies at the southern end of a volcanic massif extending north to the Tengger caldera. The steep-sided volcano, also referred to as Mahameru (Great Mountain), rises abruptly to 3676 m above coastal plains to the south. Gunung Semeru was constructed south of the overlapping Ajek-ajek and Jambangan calderas. A line of lake-filled maars was constructed along a N-S trend cutting through the summit, and cinder cones and lava domes occupy the eastern and NE flanks. Summit topography is complicated by the shifting of craters from NW to SE. Frequent 19th and 20th century eruptions were dominated by small-to-moderate explosions from the summit crater, with occasional lava flows and larger explosive eruptions accompanied by pyroclastic flows that have reached the lower flanks of the volcano. Semeru has been in almost continuous eruption since 1967."
"Tengger Caldera","112.950,-7.942","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/011027.jpg","http://www.vsi.esdm.go.id/cam_detail.php?id=16","The 16-km-wide Tengger caldera is located at the northern end of a volcanic massif extending from Semeru volcano. The massive volcanic complex dates back to about 820,000 years ago and consists of five overlapping stratovolcanoes, each truncated by a caldera. Lava domes, pyroclastic cones, and a maar occupy the flanks of the massif. The Ngadisari caldera at the NE end of the complex formed about 150,000 years ago and is now drained through the Sapikerep valley. The most recent of the calderas is the 9 x 10 km wide Sandsea caldera at the SW end of the complex, which formed incrementally during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. An overlapping cluster of post-caldera cones was constructed on the floor of the Sandsea caldera within the past several thousand years. The youngest of these is Bromo, one of Java's most active and most frequently visited volcanoes."

The currently active cone has been constructed 650 m to the SW of Gunung Tarub, the volcano's high point. As many as 27 maars with diameters from 150 to 700 m, some containing crater lakes, surround the volcano, along with about 60 cinder cones and spatter cones. Lake-filled maars, including Ranu Pakis, Ranu Klakah, and Ranu Bedali, are located on the eastern and western flanks; dry maars are predominately located on the northern flanks. None of the Lamongan maars has erupted during historical time, although several of the youthful maars cut drainage channels from Gunung Tarub. Lamongan was very active from the time of its first historical eruption in 1799 through the end of the 19th century, producing frequent explosive eruptions and lava flows from vents on the western side of the volcano ranging from the summit to about 450 m elevation."

The north caldera wall forms a prominent arcuate ridge, but elsewhere the caldera rim is buried by post-caldera volcanoes, including Gunung Merapi stratovolcano, which forms the 2799 m high point of the Ijen complex. Immediately west of Gunung Merapi is the renowned historically active Kawah Ijen volcano, which contains a nearly 1-km-wide, turquoise-colored, acid crater lake. Picturesque Kawah Ijen is the world's largest highly acidic lake and is the site of a labor-intensive sulfur mining operation in which sulfur-laden baskets are hand-carried from the crater floor. Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of post-caldera cones forms an E-W-trending zone across the southern side of the caldera. Coffee plantations cover much of the Ijen caldera floor, and tourists are drawn to its waterfalls, hot springs, and dramatic volcanic scenery."
"Kamojang, Kawah","107.800,-7.125","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/010049.jpg","","Kawah Kamojang, the first developed geothermal field in Indonesia, is located 7 km WNW of the historically active Guntur volcano within the Pleistocene Pangkalan caldera. Kawah Kamojang was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Neumann van Padang 1951) based on its geothermal activity. The 1.2 by 0.7 km thermal area consists of fumaroles, steaming ground, hot lakes, mud pots, and hydrothermally altered ground. The field is located along a WSW-ENE-trending Quaternary volcanic chain that includes Gunung Rakutak, the Ciharus, Pangkalan, and Gandapura complexes, Gunung Masigit, and Gunung Guntur. This chain is progressively younger to the ENE. Kawah Kamojang is associated with the Pangkalan and Gandapura volcanic centers, along the Kendeng fault, which extends SW to the Darajat geothermal field."
"Bratan","115.130,-8.280","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/089093.jpg","","The 11 x 6 km wide Bratan caldera (also known as Catur or Tjatur caldera or the Buyan-Bratan volcanic complex) in north-central Bali contains three caldera lakes. Several post-caldera stratovolcanoes straddle its southern rim; the largest post-caldera cone, Batukau, is 10 km to the SW. The cones are well-formed, but covered with thick soils and vegetation; they are thought to have been inactive for hundreds or thousands of years (Wheller, 1986). Tapak and Lesong cones are not covered by deposits of the youngest dacitic pumice eruptions of nearby Batur volcano, and are thus <23,000 years old. The Buyan-Bratan geothermal field within the caldera has been developed to produce electrical power, and hot springs are located in more than a dozen locations."
"Batur","115.375,-8.242","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/011069.jpg","","The historically active Batur volcano is located at the center of two concentric calderas NW of Agung volcano. The outer 10 x 13.5 km wide caldera was formed during eruption of the Bali (or Ubud) Ignimbrite about 29,300 years ago and now contains a caldera lake on its SE side, opposite the satellitic cone of 2152-m-high Gunung Abang, the topographic high of the Batur complex. The inner 6.4 x 9.4 km wide caldera was formed about 20,150 years ago during eruption of the Gunungkawi Ignimbrite. The SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The 1717-m-high Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time."
"Agung","115.508,-8.342","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017038.jpg","","Symmetrical Agung stratovolcano, Bali's highest and most sacred mountain, towers over the eastern end of the island. The volcano, whose name means 'Paramount,' rises above the SE caldera rim of neighboring Batur volcano, and the northern and southern flanks of Agung extend to the coast. The 3142-m-high summit contains a steep-walled, 500-m-wide, 200-m-deep crater. The flank cone Pawon is located low on the SE side. Only a few eruptions dating back to the early 19th century have been recorded in historical time. The 1963-64 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, produced voluminous ashfall and devastating pyroclastic flows and lahars that caused extensive damage and many fatalities."

Rinjani has a steep-sided conical profile when viewed from the east, but the west side of the compound volcano is truncated by the 6 x 8.5 km, oval-shaped Segara Anak (Samalas) caldera. The caldera formed during one of the largest Holocene eruptions globally in 1257 CE, which truncated Samalas stratovolcano. The western half of the caldera contains a 230-m-deep lake whose crescentic form results from growth of the post-caldera cone Barujari at the east end of the caldera. Historical eruptions dating back to 1847 have been restricted to Barujari cone and consist of moderate explosive activity and occasional lava flows that have entered Segara Anak lake."
"Tambora","118.000,-8.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115009.jpg","","The massive Tambora stratovolcano forms the entire 60-km-wide Sanggar Peninsula on northern Sumbawa Island. The largely trachybasaltic-to-trachyandesitic volcano grew to about 4000 m elevation before forming a caldera more than 43,000 years ago. Late-Pleistocene lava flows largely filled the early caldera, after which activity changed to dominantly explosive eruptions during the early Holocene. Tambora was the source of history's largest explosive eruption, in April 1815. Pyroclastic flows reached the sea on all sides of the peninsula, and heavy tephra fall devastated croplands, causing an estimated 60,000 fatalities. The eruption of an estimated more than 150 cu km of tephra formed a 6-km-wide, 1250-m-deep caldera and produced global climatic effects. Minor lava domes and flows have been extruded on the caldera floor at Tambora during the 19th and 20th centuries."

Tiwu Nua Muri Kooh Tai (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched, or Enchanted Lake), which share a common crater wall, are commonly green- and red-colored, respectively, although lake colors vary periodically. Active upwelling, probably fed by subaqueous fumaroles, occurs at the two eastern lakes. The scenic lakes are a popular tourist destination and have been the source of minor phreatic eruptions in historical time. The summit of the compound 1639-m-high Kelimutu volcano is elongated 2 km in a WNW-ESE direction; the older cones of Kelido and Kelibara are located respectively 3 km to the north and 2 km to the south."

Solfataric activity occurs on the crater wall and rim and on the upper southern flank. Reports of historical eruptive activity prior to explosive eruptions beginning in 2004 were inconclusive. A column of 'smoke' was often observed above the summit during 1888-1891 and in 1892. Strong 'smoke' emission in 1907 reported by Sapper (1917) was considered by the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Neumann van Padang, 1951) to be an historical eruption, but Kemmerling (1929) noted that this was likely confused with an eruption on the same date and time from Lewotobi Lakilaki volcano."

The morphologically younger Empung volcano has a 400-m-wide, 150-m-deep crater that erupted last in the 18th century, but all subsequent eruptions have originated from Tompaluan, a 150 x 250 m wide double crater situated in the saddle between the two peaks. Historical eruptions have primarily produced small-to-moderate ash plumes that have occasionally damaged croplands and houses, but lava-dome growth and pyroclastic flows have also occurred."
"Mahawu","124.858,1.358","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/012070.jpg","","The elongated Mahawu volcano immediately east of Lokon-Empung volcano is the northernmost of a series of young volcanoes along a SSW-NNE line near the margin of the Quaternary Tondano caldera. Mahawu is capped by a 180-m-wide, 140-m-deep crater that sometimes contains a small crater lake, and has two pyroclastic cones on its northern flank. Less active than its neighbor, Lokon-Empung, Mahawu's historical activity has been restricted to occasional small explosive eruptions recorded since 1789. In 1994 fumaroles, mudpots, and small geysers were observed along the shores of a greenish-colored crater lake."
"Klabat","125.030,1.470","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111100.jpg","","Klabat is an isolated symmetrical stratovolcano that rises to 1995 m near the eastern tip of the elongated northern arm of Sulawesi Island. The volcano lies east of the city of Manado (also spelled Menado) and is the highest in Sulawesi. Klabat has a shallow lake in its 170 x 250 m summit crater. No verified historical eruptions have occurred from this volcano, but fumarolic activity has occurred within historical time. A report of an eruption in 1683 probably was from nearby Tongkoko volcano."
"Tongkoko","125.200,1.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/012071.jpg","","The NE-most volcano on the island of Sulawesi, Tongkoko (also known as Tangkoko) has a summit that is elongated in a NW-SE direction with a large deep crater that in 1801 contained a cone surrounded by lake water. The slightly higher Dua Saudara stratovolcano is located only 3 km to the SW of Tongkoko, and along with Tongkoko, forms the most prominent features of Gunung Dua Saudara National Park, a noted wildlife preserve. Eruptions occurred from the summit crater of Tongkoko in the 17th century and in 1801. The prominent, flat-topped lava dome Batu Angus formed on the E flank in 1801, and along with an adjacent E-flank vent has been the source of all subsequent eruptions."
"Ruang","125.370,2.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/012075.jpg","","Ruang volcano, not to be confused with the better known Raung volcano on Java, is the southernmost volcano in the Sangihe Island arc, north of Sulawesi Island. The 4 x 5 km island volcano rises to 725 m across a narrow strait SW of the larger Tagulandang Island. The summit of Ruang volcano contains a crater partially filled by a lava dome initially emplaced in 1904. Explosive eruptions recorded since 1808 have often been accompanied by lava dome formation and pyroclastic flows that have damaged inhabited areas."
"Karangetang","125.400,2.780","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101037.jpg","","Karangetang (Api Siau) volcano lies at the northern end of the island of Siau, north of Sulawesi. The 1784-m-high stratovolcano contains five summit craters along a N-S line. Karangetang is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, with more than 40 eruptions recorded since 1675 and many additional small eruptions that were not documented in the historical record (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World: Neumann van Padang, 1951). Twentieth-century eruptions have included frequent explosive activity sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and lahars. Lava dome growth has occurred in the summit craters; collapse of lava flow fronts has also produced pyroclastic flows."
"Banua Wuhu","125.491,3.138","The Banua Wuhu submarine volcano in the Sangihe Islands rises more than 400 m from the sea floor to form a shoal less than 5 m below sea level. Several ephemeral islands were constructed during the 19th and 20th centuries. An island 90 m high was formed in 1835, but dwindled to only a few rocks by 1848. A new island formed in 1889 was 50 m high in 1894. Five new craters were formed during an eruption that built a new island in 1904. Another new island that formed in 1919 had disappeared by 1935."
"Awu","125.500,3.670","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120023.jpg","","The massive Gunung Awu stratovolcano occupies the northern end of Great Sangihe Island, the largest of the Sangihe arc. Deep valleys that form passageways for lahars dissect the flanks of the 1320-m-high volcano, which was constructed within a 4.5-km-wide caldera. Awu is one of Indonesia's deadliest volcanoes; powerful explosive eruptions in 1711, 1812, 1856, 1892, and 1966 produced devastating pyroclastic flows and lahars that caused more than 8000 cumulative fatalities. Awu contained a summit crater lake that was 1 km wide and 172 m deep in 1922, but was largely ejected during the 1966 eruption."
"Tarakan","127.830,1.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117047.jpg","","Two large cinder cones are located near the shore of Galela Bay NE of Dukono volcano. Tarakan Lamo and Tarakan Itji (large and small Tarakan) have well-formed summit craters 800 and 500 m in diameter and 160 and 125 m deep, respectively. The cinder cones lie between Galela Bay and Lake Galela, whose bottom lies below sea level. Supriatna (1980) mapped Tarakan as a basaltic volcano of Holocene age."
"Dukono","127.880,1.680","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017041.jpg","","Reports from this remote volcano in northernmost Halmahera are rare, but Dukono has been one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes. More-or-less continuous explosive eruptions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, occurred from 1933 until at least the mid-1990s, when routine observations were curtailed. During a major eruption in 1550, a lava flow filled in the strait between Halmahera and the north-flank cone of Gunung Mamuya. This complex volcano presents a broad, low profile with multiple summit peaks and overlapping craters. Malupang Wariang, 1 km SW of the summit crater complex, contains a 700 x 570 m crater that has also been active during historical time."
"Tobaru","127.670,1.630","Gunung Tobaru, also known as Gunung Lolodai, is located in northern Halmahera WSW of Dukono volcano and NNE of Ibu volcano. Supriatna (1980) mapped the little known 1035-m-high andesitic volcano as Holocene in age."
"Ibu","127.630,1.488","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100060.jpg","","The truncated summit of Gunung Ibu stratovolcano along the NW coast of Halmahera Island has large nested summit craters. The inner crater, 1 km wide and 400 m deep, contained several small crater lakes through much of historical time. The outer crater, 1.2 km wide, is breached on the north side, creating a steep-walled valley. A large parasitic cone is located ENE of the summit. A smaller one to the WSW has fed a lava flow down the W flank. A group of maars is located below the N and W flanks. Only a few eruptions have been recorded in historical time, the first a small explosive eruption from the summit crater in 1911. An eruption producing a lava dome that eventually covered much of the floor of the inner summit crater began in December 1998."
"Gamkonora","127.530,1.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/012087.jpg","","The shifting of eruption centers on Gamkonora, at 1635 m the highest peak of Halmahera, has produced an elongated series of summit craters along a N-S trending rift. Youthful-looking lava flows originate near the cones of Gunung Alon and Popolojo, south of Gamkonora. Since its first recorded eruption in the 16th century, Gamkonora has typically produced small-to-moderate explosive eruptions. Its largest historical eruption, in 1673, was accompanied by tsunamis that inundated villages."
"Jailolo","127.420,1.080","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117045.jpg","","The Jailolo volcanic complex forms a peninsula west of Jailolo Bay on the western coast of Halmahera Island. Jailolo stratovolcano at the center of the complex has youthful lava flows on its eastern flank. Small calderas are located west and SW of Jailolo. The westernmost caldera, Idamdehe, truncates an older twin volcano of Jailolo. Hot springs occur along the NW coast of the caldera. Kailupa cone forms a small volcanic island off the southern coast of the peninsula. Hot mudflows were reported from Jailolo volcano shortly prior to 1883, but no eruptions are known during historical time."
"Hiri","127.320,0.900","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104080.jpg","","Hiri, a small 3-km-wide forested island immediately north of Ternate Island, is the northernmost of a chain of volcanic islands off the western coast of Halmahera. The conical volcano rises to 630 m, but is dominated by its larger and higher neighbor to the south, historically active 1716-m-high Ternate volcano. Hiri has received less attention than Ternate, but Apandi and Sudana (1980) mapped Hiri as Holocene in age."
"Todoko-Ranu","127.470,1.250","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117046.jpg","","The twin caldera complex of Todoko-Ranu is part of a large volcanic complex south of Gamkonora. The 2-km-wide, lava-filled Todoko caldera is south of the 2 x 2.8 km wide nested Ranu calderas and contains a young post-caldera cone, Sahu, on its south flank. The northern Ranu caldera contains a caldera lake. Gunung Onu, NW of Ranu caldera, lies at the northern end of the Todoko-Ranu complex. No historical eruptions have been reported from the complex, mapped as Holocene by Supriatna (1980), but fumaroles are present at Ranu caldera and hot springs on Mt. Sahu. Youthful-looking lava flows reach the sea from several locations within the complex."
"Tidore","127.400,0.658","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/058032.jpg","","The Tidore volcanic complex consists of two dramatically different volcanic structures. The beautifully conical 1730-m-high Kiematabu peak on the south end of Tidore Island is the highest volcano of the North Maluku island chain west of Halmahera. The broad, lower Sabale volcano on the north side of the island is a caldera containing two cones. Maitara Island, 1 km off the NW coast, forms another volcanic construct. Tidore was mapped as Holocene by Apandi and Sudana (1980)."
"Mare","127.400,0.570","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117043.jpg","","The small volcanic island of Mare, immediately south of Tidore, was mapped as Holocene in age by Apandi and Sudana (1980). The 2 x 3 km island, part of a chain of volcanic islands off the western coast of Halmahera Island, is elongated in a NE-SW direction. A large breached crater at the andesitic Mare volcano is located off the SW tip of the 308-m-high island."

Moti is located north of Makian volcano and south of Mare and Tidore islands and is surrounded by coral reefs. The truncated, conical island rises to 950 m and contains a crater on its SSW side. Moti was mapped as Holocene in age by Apandi and Sudana (1980). An insignificant eruption was reported in 1774 or shorter before, but Gogarten (1918) indicated that this event was confused with the October 1773 eruption of nearby Gamalama volcano, which could have dropped ash on Moti."
"Gamalama","127.330,0.800","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/058021.jpg","","Gamalama (Peak of Ternate) is a near-conical stratovolcano that comprises the entire island of Ternate off the western coast of Halmahera and is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes. The island of Ternate was a major regional center in the Portuguese and Dutch spice trade for several centuries, which contributed to the thorough documentation of Gamalama's historical activity. Three cones, progressively younger to the north, form the summit of Gamalama, which reaches 1715 m. Several maars and vents define a rift zone, parallel to the Halmahera island arc, that cuts the volcano. Eruptions, recorded frequently since the 16th century, typically originated from the summit craters, although flank eruptions have occurred in 1763, 1770, 1775, and 1962-63."
"Tigalalu","127.420,0.070","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117007.jpg","","Gunung Tigalalu (Mount Tigalalu) is located at the northern end of Kayoa Island, which straddles the equator and is the southernmost of a chain of small volcanic islands off the western coast of Halmahera Island. Tigalalu forms a 422-m-high N-S-trending volcanic ridge at the north end of the island, part of which is flanked by coral limestones. Although much less known than its historically active neighbor to the north, Makian volcano, Tigalalu was mapped as Holocene in age by Apandi and Sudana (1980)."
"Amasing","127.480,-0.530","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117008.jpg","","Bukit Amasing (Amasing Hill) is the largest and NW-most of a group of three small andesitic volcanoes of Holocene age (Yasin, 1980). They are located along a NW-SE line on central Bacan Island, west of the southern tip of Halmahera. Two smaller volcanoes, Cakasuanggi and Dua Saudara, were constructed to the SE, north of the metamorphic complex of the Sibela Mountains. These mountains separate the Amasing volcano group from another group of three andesitic Holocene volcanoes in SE-most Bacan Island."
"Bibinoi","127.720,-0.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117001.jpg","","Bukit Bibinoi (Bibinoi Hill) is the largest and SE-most of a group of three andesitic Holocene stratovolcanoes located along a NW-SE line near the SE tip of Bacan Island, west of the southern tip of Halmahera (Yasin, 1980). The smaller Songsu and Lansa volcanoes straddle a narrow isthmus separating the SE-most peninsula of Bacan Island from the Sibela Mountains metamorphic complex. The Bibinoi volcano group lies along the same trend as the Amasing volcano group, which is located to the NW on the other side of the Sibela Mountains."
"Makian","127.400,0.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/063060.jpg","","Makian volcano forms a 10-km-wide island near the southern end of a chain of volcanic islands off the west coast of Halmahera and has been the source of infrequent, but violent eruptions that have devastated villages on the island. The large 1.5-km-wide summit crater, containing a small lake on the NE side, gives the 1357-m-high peak a flat-topped profile. Two prominent valleys extend to the coast from the summit crater on the north and east sides. Four parasitic cones are found on the western flanks. Eruption have been recorded since about 1550; major eruptions in 1646, 1760-61, 1861-62, 1890, and 1988 caused extensive damage and many fatalities."
"Bombalai","117.880,4.400","Mount Bombalai is part of a large Pliocene to Pleistocene or younger volcanic field on the Semporna Peninsula in the NE part of the island of Borneo. The volcano is part of the Malaysian province of Sabah, across Cowie Harbor from the the Indonesian province of Kalimantan. The low volcanic cone is located north of Sebatik Island and has a roughly 300-m-wide crater breached to the south. Two young lava flows extend almost to the coastal plain. The flows were considered younger than a lava flow radiocarbon dated at about 27,000 years before present, and the extrusion of basaltic lavas possibly continued into Recent (Holocene) time (Kirk, 1968). This marks the only known area of possible Holocene volcanism on Borneo. Other areas of late Quaternary dacitic and basaltic volcanism occur along the Semporna Peninsula."
"Jolo","121.057,6.013","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119036.jpg","","Numerous pyroclastic cones and craters dot 60-km-wide Jolo Island at the SW end of the Philippines archipelago. Jolo lies in the Sulu archipelago, about 150 km SW of the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula on SW Mindanao Island. The isolated location of Jolo and political unrest have inhibited geological studies of the volcanic island. Youthful-looking Tumatangus volcano forms the 811 m high point of the island. Bud Dajo (or Buddajo) is a young basaltic cinder cone that reaches 620 m elevation; nearby cones are Matanding, Guimba, and Sungal. Hot springs have been reported at craters on Cagayan Sulu, and solfataras at Siit Lake. A tsunami accompanied a possible submarine eruption in 1897. A reported eruption in 1641 actually reflected ashfall from the eruption of Parker volcano on Mindanao."
"Parker","124.892,6.113","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119040.jpg","","Parker volcano, also known locally as Falen, is a low, vegetated stratovolcano overlooking Sarangani Bay near the southern tip of Mindanao Island. The steep-sided, 1824-m-high andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano is surrounded by extensive, youthful pyroclastic-flow deposits that suggest parallels to Pinatubo volcano. The summit of Parker is truncated by a 2.9-km-wide caldera with steep-sided walls that rise 200-500 m above heart-shaped Maughan Lake. This volcano was unknown to most volcanologists until recent years, but it is now known to have been the source of a major explosive eruption in 1641 that was previously attributed to Awu volcano on Sangihe Island, Indonesia and caused darkness over the island of Mindanao. The 1641 eruption included the emplacement of voluminous pyroclastic flows and lahars and resulted in the formation of the summit caldera. This was the last of three major explosive eruptions from Parker during the last 3800 years."
"Balut","125.375,5.400","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110049.jpg","","Balut volcano, also known as Sanguil, occupies a small island in the Sarangani Island group south of the Batulaki Peninsula forming the southern tip of Mindanao Island. Hot springs and thermally altered ground are located on the west and SW flanks of the 862-m-high volcano, which rises about 1800 m above the sea floor. Reports in Mindanao of a major eruption in 1641 from an unknown volcano to the south, which caused darkness over much of Mindanao, were originally attributed to Balut volcano. Later work indicated that the source of the eruption was Parker volcano on southern Mindanao, about 80 km NW of Balut Island."
"Matutum","125.070,6.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119038.jpg","","The symmetrical Matutum stratovolcano rises to 2286 m in southern Mindanao, NW of Sarangani Bay. The summit of the andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is truncated by a well-preserved 320-m-wide crater that is breached by three gorges and has a 120-m-deep, densely forested floor. Widespread silicic pyroclastic-flow deposits surround the volcano, which overlooks the major city of General Santos. The youngest pyroclastic deposits were dated at about 2000 yrs BP. A report stated that Matutum volcano was 'smoking' on March 7, 1911 (Neumann van Padang, 1953). The Akmoan and Lianan thermal areas are located on the WSW flank of the volcano."
"Leonard Range","126.047,7.382","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117013.jpg","","An andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcano complex in the Leonard Range is truncated by a 4 x 5 km caldera partially filled by Lake Leonard. The volcano (also known as Leonard Kniazeff) is located east of the head of Davao Gulf in SE Mindanao, east of the major N-S-trending Philippine Fault. Activity at the Leonard Range dates back to 1.1 million years. A dome building stage began about 290,000 years ago, producing a series of lava domes in the region surrounding Lake Leonard. A younger stage involved the eruption of the Paloc pyroclastic deposits from the late-Pleistocene to Holocene and the formation of the caldera. Holocene radiocarbon dates ranging from about 6000 to 1800 years ago were obtained from the Paloc pyroclastic deposits. The Leonard Range (or North Davao) area has been the object of a geothermal exploration program. The Manat thermal area is located north of Lake Leonard, solfataras occur its SW rim, and active solfataras, fumaroles, and hot springs are found in the Amacan-Gopod thermal area south of the lake."
"Apo","125.269,6.989","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119062.jpg","","Apo volcano is the highest peak in the Philippines, but its geologic history is poorly known. Apo, which means master, or grandfather, rises to 2938 m SW of the coastal city of Davao and has a flat-topped summit with three peaks. The SW peak of the andesitic-to-dacitic volcano, also known as Davao volcano, is the highest and contains a 500-m-wide crater containing a small lake. The youngest crater is on the northern peak. A line of solfataras rises from a fissure on the SE side that extends from 2400 m to the summit. Apo is one of several volcanoes to which the major 1641 eruption from Parker volcano was incorrectly attributed to, but no historical eruptions are known from Apo."

Mt. Mambajao forms the high point of Camiguin Island at 1552 m. It has a youthful morphology with summit and flank lava domes, one of which partially fills a crater breached to the NW, but has not had historical eruptions. The eroded stratovolcanoes of Mt. Butay and Mt. Ginsiliban form the SE tip of the island and lie at one end of the NNW-SSE trending line of vents cutting across the island. The Binone cinder cone lies along the SE coast. The youngest volcano, and the only historically active one, is Hibok-Hibok (also known as Catarman). It lies at the NW end of the island, about 6 km NW of Mt. Mambajao. This andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcano contains several lava domes, including Mt. Vulcan on its NW flank. Major eruptions during 1871-75 and 1948-53 formed flank lava domes at Hibok-Hibok and produced pyroclastic flows that devastated coastal villages."

Thick lava flows occur on the flanks of this andesitic-to-ryholitic volcano. Masaraga was classified as Holocene by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI, 1973), and K-Ar dates of zero age were obtained from this volcano."
"Mayon","123.685,13.257","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/017077.jpg","","Beautifully symmetrical Mayon volcano, which rises to 2462 m above the Albay Gulf, is the Philippines' most active volcano. The structurally simple volcano has steep upper slopes averaging 35-40 degrees that are capped by a small summit crater. Historical eruptions at this basaltic-andesitic volcano date back to 1616 and range from strombolian to basaltic plinian, with cyclical activity beginning with basaltic eruptions, followed by longer term andesitic lava flows. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the approximately 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1200 people and devastated several towns."
"Iriga","123.457,13.457","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/018049.jpg","","Mount Iriga is a small stratovolcano that rises to 1196 m immediately SW of Lake Buhi. The dominantly andesitic stratovolcano has satellitic cinder cones of basaltic composition. A large breached crater that opens to the SE was formed as a result of a major debris avalanche that buried several villages and formed a broad hummocky deposit that extends across the plain south of Lake Buhi. This catastrophic event was at one time considered to have occurred during 1628 CE, but later work has shown that the collapse and eruption occurred earlier at some unknown date during the Holocene. The avalanche was followed by phreatic explosions that created a small crater at the base of the scarp."

Banahaw is flanked by San Cristobal volcano on the west and Banahaw de Lucban on the NE. Andesitic-to-dacitic lava domes occur on the flanks of Banahaw and San Cristobal. Two major Holocene debris avalanches have occurred at Banahaw volcano. The deposit from one extends 13 km to the NE and the other 26 km to the SE, where it forms 10 km of the coastline of Tayabas Bay. San Cristobal stratovolcano rises to 1480 m, 7 km west of Banahaw. Its youthful morphology suggests that it postdates Banahaw. Banahaw de Lucban is a 1875-m-high stratovolcano that was constructed within the 8-km-wide, horseshoe-shaped caldera related to the two debris avalanches, and is the youngest volcano of the Banahaw complex. The 2-km-wide, 600-m-deep summit crater of Banahaw is open to the SSW and contained a crater lake until 1730, when it drained, forming mudflows. Mudflows were also recorded in 1743?, 1843 and 1909, possibly also associated with explosive activity."

In contrast to Mayon volcano, Taal is not topographically prominent, but its prehistorical eruptions have greatly changed the topography of SW Luzon. The 15 x 20 km Talisay (Taal) caldera is largely filled by Lake Taal, whose 267 sq km surface lies only 3 m above sea level. The maximum depth of the lake is 160 m, and several eruptive centers lie submerged beneath the lake. The 5-km-wide Volcano Island in north-central Lake Taal is the location of all historical eruptions. The island is a complex volcano composed of coalescing small stratovolcanoes, tuff rings, and scoria cones that has grown about 25% in area during historical time. Powerful pyroclastic flows and surges from historical eruptions of Taal have caused many fatalities."

Ruaya and Panem (1991) listed the age of the dominantly andesitic volcano as late Pliocene to Pleistocene, but gave a probable age of the latest activity as Holocene to upper Pleistocene. Five thermal areas are present in the summit region."
"Pinatubo","120.350,15.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/019014.jpg","","Prior to 1991 Pinatubo volcano was a relatively unknown, heavily forested lava dome complex located 100 km NW of Manila with no records of historical eruptions. The 1991 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption. At least six major eruptive periods, interrupted by lengthy quiescent periods, have occurred from modern Pinatubo volcano during the past 35,000 years. Most of these have produced major pyroclastic flows and lahars that were even more extensive than in 1991."
"Arayat","120.742,15.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/089055.jpg","","The forested Arayat volcano is one of the few topographic features that rise above the flat Central Plain of Luzon Island. Weak steaming occurs at the NW side of the 1026-m-high summit, which rises NE of the city of Angeles. A large breached crater on the WNW side is the apparent source of a major debris-avalanche deposit that forms hummocky terrain beyond the west and NW sides of the volcano. Post-collapse activity formed an andesitic dome known as White Rock in the collapse amphitheater. There are no reports of historical eruptions from Arayat. Although the volcano was listed as active during the past 2000 years (IAVCEI, 1973), perhaps referring to its thermal activity, the only dated rocks are 0.53 and 0.65 million-year-old basalts that predated collapse and formation of the lava dome."

Ambalatungan volcano proper contains a steep-walled crater with hot springs and vigorous sulfur-encrusted fumarolic vents that produce loud noises. Bumabag volcano, 3 km east of Ambalatungan, has two craters that also show strong fumarolic activity. Podakan volcano, 1 km SE of Bumabag, also has a large steam vent. A possible steam eruption was reported from 2329-m-high Mount Binuluan (whose relationship to the previously mentioned volcanoes is unclear) in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people."
"Laguna Caldera","121.270,14.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091009.jpg","","The elliptical, 10 x 20 km wide Laguna Caldera SE of Manila forms the middle lake-filled basin of the three-pronged, dinosaur-footprint-shaped Laguna de Bay, the largest lake on Luzon Island. Pre-caldera Pleistocene volcanism formed basaltic to basaltic-andesitic volcanoes, including Talim Island and Mount Sembrano stratovolcanoes on opposite sides of the current caldera. The caldera, whose lake surface is only 1 m above sea level, may have formed during at least two major explosive eruptions about 1 million and 27,000-29,000 years ago. Post-caldera volcanism formed maars of young, but unknown age at the southern end of elongated Talim Island, which forms the SW rim of the caldera.

From about 600,000 to 300,000 years ago thick pyroclastic flows covered the entire volcano. Recent periods of phreatomagmatic activity have produced ash flows. The forested volcano is locally known as the 'Mountain of Fire.' A phreatic explosion in 1860 may have been accompanied by a pyroclastic flow. Strong solfataric activity occurred in 1907, and thermal areas are located near the summit crater and on the NW to NNE flanks."

"Tengchong","98.500,25.230","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/067092.jpg","","The Tengchong volcanic district, located in southern China near the border with Burma (Myanmar), was active during five periods ranging from the early Pliocene to the Holocene. Three main stages prroduced Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene basaltic rocks, mid- to late-Pleistocene silicic pyroclastic rocks, and Holocene basaltic andesites. The youngest volcanism in the 600 sq km volcanic field occurred in two stages during the early and late Holocene. Volcanic cones at the northern end of the field are sparsely vegetated and have clearly visible lava flows. Three basaltic-andesite centers, Dayinshshan, Maanshan, and possibly Heikongshan, are of Holocene age. An unconfirmed explosive eruption took place in 1609, and there are unconfirmed reports of eruptions in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The Tengchong district is the site of active geothermal fields, the largest and highest temperature of which is the Rehai geothermal field. More than 20 hydrothermal eruptions have occurred at the Rehai geothermal field since 1993."

The summit of the volcano is truncated by a large breached crater extending to the sea on the east flank that was formed by edifice collapse. Suwanosejima, one of Japan's most frequently active volcanoes, was in a state of intermittent strombolian activity from Otake, the NE summit crater, that began in 1949 and lasted until 1996, after which periods of inactivity lengthened. The largest historical eruption took place in 1813-14, when thick scoria deposits blanketed residential areas, and the SW crater produced two lava flows that reached the western coast. At the end of the eruption the summit of Otake collapsed forming a large debris avalanche and creating the horseshoe-shaped Sakuchi caldera, which extends to the eastern coast. The island remained uninhabited for about 70 years after the 1813-1814 eruption. Lava flows reached the eastern coast of the island in 1884. Only about 50 persons live on the island."

Growth of the Younger Fuji volcano began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8000 years before present (BP), accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the Younger Fuji volcano. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8000 to 4500 BP, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4500 to 3000 BP. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3000 to 2000 BP, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainages against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes, popular resort destinations. The last confirmed eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 was Fuji's largest during historical time. It deposited ash on Edo (Tokyo) and formed a large new crater on the east flank."

Ascending this volcano is one of the major objects of religious pilgrimage in central Japan. It is constructed within a largely buried 4 x 5 km caldera and occupies the southern end of the Norikura volcanic zone, which extends northward to Yakedake volcano. The older volcanic complex consisted of at least four major stratovolcanoes constructed from about 680,000 to about 420,000 years ago, after which Ontakesan was inactive for more than 300,000 years. The broad, elongated summit of the younger edifice is cut by a series of small explosion craters along a NNE-trending line. Several phreatic eruptions post-date the roughly 7300-year-old Akahoya tephra from Kikai caldera. The first historical eruption took place in 1979 from fissures near the summit. A non-eruptive landslide in 1984 produced a debris avalanche and lahar that swept down valleys south and east of the volcano. Very minor phreatic activity caused a dusting of ash near the summit in 1991 and 2007. A significant phreatic explosion in September 2014, when a large number of hikers were at or near the summit, resulted in many fatalities."

The Megata maars are mostly late Pleistocene in age, but Murayama (1987) noted that pottery from roughly 4000 years before present (Jomon Period) has been found within tephra layers from the maars."
"Akita-Yakeyama","140.757,39.964","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/105002.jpg","","One of several Japanese volcanoes named Yakeyama ('Burning Mountain'), Akita-Yakeyama is the most recently active of a group of coalescing volcanoes in NW Honshu immediately west of Hachimantai volcano. The main volcano, Yakeyama, contains a small lava dome in its 600-m-wide summit crater. Tsugamori volcano to the east is a stratovolcano of roughly the same height and has a 2-km-wide crater breached to the NE. The flat-topped parasitic lava dome of Kuroshimori lies 4 km south of Yakedake. Tamagawa Spa at the western foot, one of several thermal areas, is strongly radioactive. The last magmatic eruption formed the Onigajo lava dome in the summit crater about 5000 years ago. The only known historical activity has consisted of somewhat uncertain 19th-century eruptions and mild phreatic eruptions in the 20th century."
"Towada","140.880,40.510","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/064052.jpg","","The dramatic, 11-km-wide, lake-filled Towada caldera formed during as many as six major explosive eruptions over a 40,000-year period ending about 13,000 years ago. Pre-caldera eruptive activity dates back about 2 million years and produced basaltic-to-dacitic lava cones. Following late-Pleistocene andesitic-to-rhyolitic caldera-forming eruptions, the basaltic Ninokura stratovolcano grew in the SSE section of the caldera. Successive dacitic-to-rhyolitic Goshikiiwa explosive eruptions led to the formation of the roughly 2-km-wide Nakanoumi caldera, whose SW and NE rims form dramatic peninsulas extending into Lake Towada. The andesitic-to-dacitic Ogura-yama lava dome was built over the NE rim of Nakanoumi. The latest eruption took place in 915 CE, when eruptions from Ogurayama produced widespread ashfall and pyroclastic flows."

A northern group of volcanoes, constructed within the caldera, appears to be younger than the southern group. Hakkoda-Odake, Ido-dake, and Tsurugi-dake have well-preserved craters. Akakura-dake has a 1-km-wide explosion crater breached to the north. No historical eruptions are known, although an active solfatara occurs at Ido-dake, and hot springs are found at several locations within the caldera. Three minor phreatic eruptions were documented from Jigoku-numa on the SW flank of Odake volcano from the 13th-17th centuries.

Dissected lava domes ring the caldera floor. The andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is largely Pleistocene in age, with activity dating back about 800,000 years. The last identified distal tephra deposit was erupted during the late Pleistocene. The only report of historical activity was in a Tohoku district travel document published in 1787, which stated that Yakeyama in Mutsu country (Osoreyama) had erupted. Older residents reported that large fires and clouds were sometimes seen from the summit, accounting for the volcano's local name, Yakeyama, or 'Burning Mountain' (Murayama, 1987). Earthquake swarms have been documented during the second half of the 20th century, and magma bodies have been detected beneath the volcano."

The broad, low stratovolcano forms an 11 x 13 km island and was constructed over the remnants of three dissected stratovolcanoes. It is capped by a 4-km-wide caldera with a central cone, Miharayama, that has been the site of numerous historical eruptions. More than 40 parasitic cones are located within the caldera and along two parallel rift zones trending NNW-SSE. Although it is a dominantly basaltic volcano, strong explosive activity has occurred at intervals of 100-150 years throughout the past few thousand years. Historical activity dates back to the 7th century CE. A major eruption in 1986 produced spectacular lava fountains up to 1600 m height and a 16-km-high subplinian eruption column; more than 12,000 persons were evacuated from the island."

It is comprised of eight low rhyolitic lava domes that are clustered in two groups at the northern and southern ends of the island, separated by a low, flat isthmus. The flat-topped domes give the island the appearance of two large plateaus bounded by steep cliffs. The Mukaiyama complex at the southern end of the island and Achiyama lava dome at the northern end were formed during Niijima's only historical eruptions in the 9th century CE. Shikineyama and Zinaito domes form small islands immediately to the SW and west, respectively, during earlier stages of volcanism. Earthquake swarms occurred during the 20th century."

The youngest and largest of the 18 lava domes, 574-m-high Tenjoyama, occupies the central portion of the island. Most of the older domes, some of which are Holocene in age, flank Tenjoyama to the north, although late-Pleistocene domes are also found at the southern end of the island. Only two possible historical eruptions, from the 9th century, are known. A lava flow may have reached the sea during an eruption in 832 CE. Tenjosan lava dome was formed during a major eruption in 838 CE that also produced pyroclastic flows and surges. Earthquake swarms took place during the 20th century."

The sparsely populated island consists of a large stratovolcano with lava domes on the SE side. Several small sea stacks are located immediately offshore, including one 73 m high off the SE tip of the island. Growth of the stratovolcano took place until about 7000 years ago, and the latest activity occurred about 6000 years ago, when explosive eruptions and pyroclastic surges accompanied lava dome growth."

The basaltic volcano is truncated by small summit calderas, one of which, 3.5 km wide, was formed during a major eruption about 2500 years ago. Parasitic craters and vents, including maars near the coast and radially oriented fissure vents, dot the flanks of the volcano. Frequent historical eruptions have occurred since 1085 CE at vents ranging from the summit to below sea level, causing much damage on this small populated island. After a three-century-long hiatus ending in 1469, activity has been dominated by flank fissure eruptions sometimes accompanied by minor summit eruptions. A 1.6-km-wide summit caldera was slowly formed by subsidence during an eruption in 2000; by October of that year the crater floor had dropped to only 230 m above sea level."

The eroded Pleistocene-to-Holocene Higashiyama volcano occupies the SE end of the 14-km-long island, and the symmetrical Holocene Nishiyama volcano the NW end. Parasitic cones occur on the SE flank of Nishiyama. The small volcanic island of Kojima lies several kilometers W of Hachijojima. Growth of Higashiyama began several tens of thousands of years ago, and included the formation of two small calderas. The initial submarine and early subaerial eruptions of Nishiyama took place from 10,000 to 8000 years before present (BP). Its latest major activity, from the early Holocene until about 4000 BP, was restricted to flank eruptions. Historical eruptions of Hachijojima, recorded since the 15th century, have been restricted to the summit of Nishiyama and a submarine vent of unknown location."

The 6-7 km wide caldera, one of nine along this arc, has walls 500-900 m high. The high point on the western rim is a pumice-mantled remnant of the pre-collapse volcanic complex that reaches a depth of 360 m. The caldera walls reveal rhyolitic lava flows, shallow intrusions, and volcaniclastic deposits. A voluminous blanket of coarse rhyolitic pumice from the caldera-forming eruption mantles the rim and outer flanks. Post-caldera eruptions formed a lava dome that rises 250 m above the caldera floor. The age of the caldera is not known, but was considered by Fiske et al. (2001) to perhaps be as young as a few thousand years. An active hydrothermal vent field lies on the eastern caldera floor and has produced a polymetallic sulfide deposit from vent chimneys up to 30 m high that emit fluids as hot as 278 degrees C."

Two pyroclastic cones were formed inside the caldera during the latest eruption from 1780 to 1785. Growth of the volcano began with construction of the Kurosaki stratovolcano in the NW part of the island, after which the main stratovolcano began growing in the SE. Both summit and flank vents produced pyroclastic surges and lava flows. Late in the construction of the main cone a 1-1.5 km crater was formed on the SE flank. About 3000 years ago pyroclastic surges swept over the entire island. During about the next 600 years, lava flows and scoria deposits filled the SE crater, which also collapsed repeatedly. The current Ikenosawa crater was considered by Takada et al. (1992) to have formed by ring collapse at the time of a debris avalanche, after which the volcano was quiescent until the eruptions of historical time."

Formation of the 8-9 km wide caldera was followed by construction of a large (2.6 cu km) lava dome and/or lava flow complex on the caldera floor, originally located at a depth of 1000-1100 m. Most historical eruptions, recorded since the late-19th century, have occurred from the large post-caldera Myojinsho lava dome on the NE rim of the caldera. Deposits from submarine pyroclastic flows associated with growth of the dacitic lava dome mantle the conical dome and extend into the NE part of the caldera and down its outer slopes. An explosive submarine eruption from Myojinsho in 1952 destroyed a Japanese research vessel, killing all 31 on board. Submarine eruptions have also been observed from other points on the caldera rim and outside of the caldera.

It is one of about a dozen displaying hydrothermal activity in the southern part of the Izu-Marianas chain. A steep-walled, 50-m-wide cylindrical crater on the north flank, about 75 m below the summit, is at least 135 m deep and was observed to emit cloudy hydrothermal fluid. During a NOAA expedition in 2006, scientists observed a convecting, black pool of liquid sulfur with a partly solidified, undulating sulfur crust at a depth of 420 m below the summit. Gases, particulate with the appearance of smoke, and liquid sulfur were bubbling up from the back edge of the sulfur pool."

Water discoloration has been observed there, and in 1979 the crew of a fishing boat felt shocks over the summit area of the seamount, followed by upwelling of sulfur-bearing water. On 24-25 April 2001 an explosive eruption was detected seismically by a station on Rangiroa Atoll, Tuamotu Archipelago. The event was well constrained (+/- 15 km) at a location near the southern base of Ahyi. An eruption in April-May 2014 was detected by NOAA divers, hydroacoustic sensors, and seismic stations."
"Supply Reef","145.100,20.130","Supply Reef is a conical submarine volcano in the northern Mariana Islands that rises to within 8 m of the surface. The andesitic seamount lies about 10 km NW of the Maug Islands, the emergent summit of a submarine volcano that is joined to Supply Reef by a low saddle at a depth of about 1800 m. Supply Reef was mapped as Quaternary; living corals on the crater rim suggest that it is either dormant or extinct (Corwin, 1971). Several submarine eruptions have been detected by sonar signals originating from points very approximately located at distances of 15-25 km NW."
"Maug Islands","145.220,20.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095017.jpg","","Three small elongated islands up to 2.3 km long mark the northern, western, and eastern rims of a largely submerged 2.5-km-wide caldera. The highest point of the Maug Islands reaches only 227 m above sea level; the submerged southern notch on the caldera rim lies about 140 m below sea level. The caldera has an average submarine depth of about 200 m and contains a twin-peaked central lava dome that rises to within about 20 m of the sea surface. The Maug Islands form a twin volcanic massif with Supply Reef, about 11 km N. The truncated inner walls of the caldera on all three islands expose lava flows and pyroclastic deposits that are cut by radial dikes; bedded ash deposits overlie the outer flanks of the islands. No eruptions are known since the discovery of the islands by Espinosa in 1522. The presence of poorly developed coral reefs and coral on the central lava dome suggests a long period of general quiescence, although it does not exclude mild eruptions (Corwin, 1971). A 2003 NOAA expedition detected possible evidence of submarine geothermal activity."

Its relatively frequent historical eruptions dating back to the mid-19th century have caused the andesitic volcano to be referred to as the 'Lighthouse of the western Pacific.' The symmetrical, sparsely vegetated summit is the central cone within a small caldera cutting an older edifice, remnants of which are seen on the SE and southern sides near the coast. Flank fissures have fed lava flows during historical time that form platforms along the coast. Both summit and flank vents have been active during historical time. Eruptions have also been observed from nearby submarine vents, and Makhahnas seamount, which rises to within 640 m of the sea surface, lies about 10 km to the SW."

The southern flank is cut by a large landslide scar. The southern flanks and western flanks are mantled by ash deposits that may have originated during eruptions in historical time. An explosive eruption in 1906 also produced lava flows that descended about half way down the western and SE flanks, but several other historical eruption reports are of uncertain validity.

Deep radial valley dissect the flanks of the thickly vegetated stratovolcano. The elongated caldera is 1 x 2 km wide and is breached to the NW, from where a prominent lava flow extends to the coast and forms a lava delta. The caldera floor is surfaced by fresh-looking lava flows and also contains two cones that may have formed during the volcano's only historical eruption in 1917.

The latter has three coalescing cones and a breached summit crater that fed lava flows to the west and NW. The 287-m high point of the island is the south rim of the caldera. Freycinet misidentifed Guguan with Alamagan; reported eruptions in 1819 and 1901 (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) actually refer to solfataric activity on Alamagan (Corwin, 1971).

The 1660-m-high volcano is located along a ridge 5 km SW of Shiretoko-Iozan volcano, the NE-most Holocene volcano in Hokkaido. Young lava flows descend the NW flank and broad areas along the SE flank, and an older lava flow traveled about 9 km W, reaching the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk along a broad front. Eruptions produced pumiceous tephras with associated pyroclastic flows about 2200, 1400, and 800 years ago. Recent work has documented a pyroclastic-flow deposit that overlies the 1739 tephra from Tarumai volcano in SW Hokkaido. Stratigraphic relationships place this eruption, the most recent known from Rausudake, between about 1750 and 1850 CE."
"Kussharo","144.443,43.608","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/022037.jpg","","The 20 x 26 km Kussharo caldera (also spelled Kutcharo or Kuccharo), is the largest of a cluster of calderas in NE Hokkaido. The caldera was formed in a series of major eruptions between about 340,000 and 30,000 years ago. Nakajima, a Holocene post-caldera dacitic-to-rhyolitic lava-dome complex, forms an island in the large lake that fills much of the western half of the caldera. The Holocene Atosanupuri stratovolcano and lava-dome complex is located near the center of the caldera, east of the crescent-shaped Lake Kutcharo. Many lava domes were formed between about 1000-10,000 years ago. No historical eruptions are known, although intense fumarolic activity occurs on and around Atosanupuri volcano and along the shores of Lake Kutcharo."

Located at the NE tip of Hokkaido on the Shiretoko Peninsula, the andesitic volcano contains two large craters at the summit that are breached to the NW. The southern crater contains a small flat-topped lava dome. The main cone, Nakadake, was constructed NW of the headwalls of the two breached craters. Historical eruptions have originated from the southernmost of three explosion craters along a NNE-SSW line on the NW flank of the main cone."
"Nigorikawa","140.450,42.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096009.jpg","","The Mori geothermal field is located in the late-Pleistocene Nigorikawa caldera in SW Hokkaido. The small 3-km-wide caldera along the shores of Uchiura Bay WNW of Komagatake volcano, was formed during a major explosive eruption about 12,000 years ago. The caldera-forming eruption included the emplacement of pyroclastic-fall and -surge deposits and pyroclastic-flow deposits that extend north and west to the Pacific coast. The flat-bottomed caldera floor is intersected by roads and houses of the town of Nigorigawa, and a river of the same name drains the caldera to the NE through a notch in the caldera rim."
"Tenchozan","145.086,44.044","Phreatic eruptions at Tenchozan occurred approximately 1,900 years ago. Towards the end of those eruptions there was a phreatomagmatic or small magmatic eruption. The chain of explosion craters, stretching from the northeast to the southwest, are considered to be a result of this series of eruptions (Goto et al., 2005; Goto, 2011)."

Explosive activity has dominated in the formation of this andesitic-dacitic volcano; no lava flows are exposed. The gently sloping stratovolcano, is truncated by a 4-5 km wide caldera that formed during a series of late-Pleistocene eruptions beginning about 43,00 years ago. Several lava domes were subsequently emplaced on the caldera floor. Topographic highs outside the caldera rim define a series of lava domes extruded along a ring structure or an outer caldera. A 1 x 2.5 km caldera lake on the northern side of the inner caldera drains through a narrow breach in the western caldera wall. Solfataric activity occurs at the northern lake shore and at explosion craters (one of which contains a hot crater lake with reported temperatures from 36-100 degrees C) that cut the caldera-floor lava domes. The only known historical eruption was a minor explosion in 1848."

On the S flank is the Smirnov stratovolcano, a gently sloping 1189-m-high structure that in part retains a constructional form, but the southern side has been heavily eroded by glaciers, exposing its Tertiary basement. A wide glacial trough on the SE flank of Smirnov contains a pyroclastic cone at its head that fed a 4-km-long lava flow. Another pyroclastic cone is located at the base of the trough near the terminus of the lava flow. Two fresh-looking lava domes of Holocene age also lie within the glacial valley to the north."

The dominantly andesitic-dacitic volcano is cut by two nested calderas, the larger 6-7 km in diameter and the smaller 3-3.5 km. A central cone that formed inside the younger caldera was breached to the west by a large debris avalanche about 4200 years ago. A lava dome that grew inside the avalanche scarp forms the 888 m high point of the volcano. Additional lava domes in the northern part of the older caldera are considered to represent flank activity of the younger caldera. The only unambiguous historical eruption was a small phreatic explosion in 1880. Four solfatara fields lie at the eastern and northern flanks of the central cone, and a geothermal field is located outside the caldera along the eastern coast."

The edifice occupies the NE tip of Kunashir Island and morphologically resembles Mount Vesuvius. The pristine-looking conical central cone, mostly formed by basaltic to basaltic-andesite strombolian eruptions, rises 400 m above the floor of the caldera and contains a 400 x 250 m wide crater with two explosion vents separated by a linear septum. Fresh lava flows cover much of the SW caldera floor and have overflowed the rim, extending to the foot of the older somma, which formed during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. A lava flow from a flank cone on the northern caldera rim reached the Sea of Okhotsk. A major explosive eruption in 1973 followed an initial historical eruption in 1812."
"Moekeshiwan Lvinaya Past","146.994,44.608","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/108016.jpg","","The rim of the dramatic 7 x 9 km Moekeshiwan Lvinaya Past caldera on southern Iturup Island drops to 50 m below sea level on the NW side. Lvinaya Past, meaning Lion's Jaw, derives from a rock resembling a sleeping lion that breaches the surface at the center of the submerged caldera rim. A shallow 5-km-wide passageway on the NW side allows the Sea of Okhotsk into the caldera basin, whose floor is 550 m below sea level and lies almost 1 km below the caldera rim. The caldera formed about 9400 years ago during one of the largest Holocene eruptions in the Kuril Islands. Thick dacitic pumice deposits from this eruption form the 50-60 m high Yuzhny (Southern) isthmus, which joins the three southernmost volcanoes on Iturup Island, Rokko, Moekeshiwan, and Berutarubesan."

The flanks of the andesitic-to-dacitic volcano are deeply dissected by wide glacial valleys; a low saddle on the NE side separates it from the slopes of the Lvinaya Past caldera. The only known Holocene activity produced a small pyroclastic cone that was superposed on the intersecting headwalls of U-shaped valleys and cirques on the volcano's broad eroded summit. The hydrothermally altered summit cone was the source of two small lava flows. Berutarubesan was estimated to have ceased erupting only a few hundred to at most 1000 years ago (Gorshkov, 1970). No confirmed historical eruptions are known, although fumarolic areas on the walls of the summit crater are currently depositing sulfur."

A somma volcano whose caldera rim is exposed only at about 900 m elevation on the SE side was constructed during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, forming an island up to about 1.5 km high that was later connected to the main island by erosional material. A fault with large displacement offsets the NW side of the somma. The 2-km-wide caldera was subsequently largely overtopped by a central cone that forms the present 1206-m-high summit. Strombolian eruptions have dominated the history of this basaltic volcano; few lava flows are exposed. Only two historical eruptions are known, during 1812 and 1932."

Lava flows from both edifices are truncated by a large, 4-km-wide depression on the west side of the peninsula. Basaltic rocks dominate at both volcanoes over basaltic-andesite and andesitic products. Kitachirippusan has a shallow summit crater, partially filled by a small lake, that has fed lava flows down all sides; satellitic cones are located on the northern flank. Lava flows from Minamichirippusan reach the coast on both the east and west sides. Only two 19th-century eruptions are known in historical time, the last occurring in 1860 from a vent SE of the summit of Minamichirippusan."

Two overlapping calderas, 14 x 18 and 10 x 12 km in diameter, were formed during the Pleistocene. The caldera floor contains several lava domes, cinder cones and associated lava fields, and a small lake. Four small closely spaced stratovolcanoes were constructed along an E-W line on the eastern side of the complex. The easternmost and highest, Medvezhii, lies outside the western caldera, along the Pacific coast. Srednii, Tukap, and Kudriavy (Moyorodake) volcanoes lie immediately to the west. Historically active Moyorodake is younger than 2000 years; it and Tukap remain fumarolically active. The westernmost of the post-caldera cones, Menshoi Brat, is a large lava dome with flank scoria cones, one of which has produced a series of young lava flows up to 4.5 km long that reached Slavnoe Lake. Eruptions have been documented since the 18th century, although lava flows from cinder cones on the flanks of Menshoi Brat were also probably erupted within the past few centuries."

Trezubetz, whose name means 'Trident,' has an eroded crater rim with three large peaks when seen at sea from the north. Kolokol rises to 1328 m and is sometimes known as Urup-Fuji because of its symmetrical profile. The crater of Kolokol is not well preserved, but there is no evidence of glacial erosion. Several lava flows originate from Kolokol; one of these extends almost to the Sea of Okhotsk coast; a viscous lava flow armoring the SE flank is probably the most recent. Borzov volcano, the oldest of the group, lies to the SW of Kolokol. Eruptions of the Kolokol group have been observed in historical time since the late-18th century. Berg volcano has been most active, but Trezubetz erupted in 1924."

The outer flanks of the steep-sided 1500-m-high volcano are dissected by deep gullies. A 3-km-wide caldera breached widely to the SE was formed during the Pleistocene and became a center of glaciation. A small central cone capped by an andesitic lava dome was constructed within the caldera during postglacial time and forms the highest point on Simushir Island. Lava flows from the cone descend 4-5 km to the sea. Goriaschaia Sopka, previously identified as a distinct volcano, is a historically active andesitic lava dome that grew just beyond what appears to be a NE-SW erosional scarp along the NW flank. Numerous fresh lava flows with prominent marginal levees extend from the dome, with some reaching the sea.

Several young cones and lava domes are located near the margins of Biryuzovoe caldera lake. Lacustrine sediments overlying pumice deposits indicate that an earlier caldera lake lay at 200 m above sea level, well above the present lake surface. Two eruptions have occurred at Zavaritzki during the 20th century. A lava dome that was emplaced sometime between 1916 and 1931 forms a small island in the northern part of the caldera lake.

Young-looking lava flows reach both coasts of central Simushir Island, and those on the south flank (Pacific Ocean side) have a particularly youthful appearance. Two small pyroclastic cones on the western flank have produced lava flows that reach to or near the Sea of Okhotsk. Only two eruptions are known from Prevo Peak in historical time. The largest of these, during the 1760s, produced pyroclastic flows that destroyed all vegetation at the foot of the volcano.

A small 1.6-km-wide caldera that formed about 9400 years ago is narrowly breached on the south, allowing sea water to fill the caldera. Two andesitic lava domes occupy part of the caldera bay; two other older domes are joined by a sand bar to the SE caldera wall. The two younger domes, erupted sometime after the 1769 visit of Captain Snow, form islands in the bay. A cluster of strong fumaroles and hot springs along the SE caldera shoreline was a sacred place to 18th- and 19th-century Kurile Ainu peoples, and vigorous submarine hydrothermal activity has modified the geochemistry of sea water within the caldera bay.

The oval-shaped basaltic island is only 2 x 2.5 km wide and rises above a submarine terrace with a depth of 130 m. The steep-walled crater, highest on the SE side, is 700 m wide and 200 m deep. Lava flows mantle the eastern side of the island. A catastrophic eruption of Raikoke in 1778 during which the upper third of the island was said to have been destroyed prompted the first volcanological investigation in the Kuril Islands two years later. Reports of eruptions in 1777 and 1780 are erroneous (Gorshkov, 1970). Another powerful eruption in 1924 greatly deepened the crater and changed the outline of the island."
"Chirinkotan","153.480,48.980","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/108006.jpg","","The small, mostly unvegetated 3-km-wide island of Chirinkotan occupies the far end of an E-W-trending volcanic chain that extends nearly 50 km west of the central part of the main Kuril Islands arc. Chirinkotan is the emergent summit of a volcano that rises 3000 m from the floor of the Kuril Basin. A small 1-km-wide caldera about 300-400 m deep is open to the SE. Lava flows from a cone within the breached crater reached the north shore of the island. Historical eruptions have been recorded at Chirinkotan since the 18th century. Fresh lava flows also descended the SE flank of Chirinkotan during an eruption in the 1880s that was observed by the English fur trader Captain Snow."
"Ekarma","153.930,48.958","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Ekarma_-_Landsat_7.jpg","","The small 5 x 7.5 km island of Ekarma lies 8.5 km north of Shiashkotan Island along an E-W-trending volcanic chain extending westward from the central part of the main Kuril Island arc. Ekarma is composed of two overlapping basaltic-andesite to andesitic volcanoes, the western of which has been historically active. Lava flows radiate 3 km in all directions from the summit of the younger cone to the sea, forming a lobate shoreline. A lava dome that was emplaced during the first historical eruption, in 1776-79, forms the peaked, 1170-m-high summit of the island."
"Sinarka","154.175,48.875","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104067.jpg","","Sinarka volcano, occupying the northern end of Shiashkotan Island in the central Kuriles, has a complex structure. A small, 2-km-wide depression open to the NW has been largely filled and overtopped by an andesitic postglacial central cone that itself contains a lava dome that forms the 934 m high point of the island. Another lava dome, Zheltokamennaya Mountain, lies 1.5 km to the SW along the buried SW rim of the caldera, and a smaller dome lies along the northern caldera rim. Historical eruptions have occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries. The last and largest of these, during 1872-78, was once thought to originate from Kuntomintar volcano at the southern end of the island, but is now attributed to Sinarka (Gorshkov, 1970)."
"Kharimkotan","154.508,49.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/086035.jpg","","The 8 x 12 km island of Kharimkotan (also spelled Harimkotan) in the northern Kuriles consists of a stratovolcano cut by two breached depressions on the east and NW sides. These horseshoe-shaped craters were formed by slope failure, which produced debris-avalanche deposits that form large broad peninsulas on the east and NW coasts. Evidence of additional slope failures followed by plinian eruptions are found in sea cliffs of the island. Historical explosive eruptions have occurred since the early 18th century. A central cone, Severgin, was largely destroyed during the 1933 eruption, one of the largest in the Kuril Islands during historical time. Impact of a debris avalanche into the sea from the collapse of Severgin produced a tsunami that swept the island's coast and reached Onekotan and Paramushir Islands, killing two persons. A large lava dome emplaced during the 1933 eruption now fills the head of the eastern crater."
"Tao-Rusyr Caldera","154.700,49.350","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/022068.jpg","","The 7.5-km-wide Tao-Rusyr caldera on southern Onekotan Island is one of the most impressive volcanoes of the Kuril Islands. The basaltic-to-andesitic caldera is filled by the deep-blue 7-km-wide Kal'tsevoe lake, whose surface is 400 m above sea level. The caldera was formed about 7500 years ago during one of the largest Holocene eruptions in the Kuril Islands. A large symmetrical post-caldera cone, 1325-m-high andesitic Krenitzyn Peak, forms a 4-km wide island that towers high above the caldera rim and fills the NW portion of the caldera lake. A 350-m-wide, 100-m-deep crater truncates the peak and a large lateral crater is located on the upper NE side. The only historical eruption of Krenitzyn Peak, in 1952, formed a small, mostly lacustral lava dome in an explosion crater along the east shore of the island."
"Nemo Peak","154.808,49.570","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091060.jpg","","Nemo Peak volcano at the northern end of Onekotan Island in the northern Kuriles is truncated by two nested calderas of preglacial age, the largest of which is 10 km in diameter and extends to the northern coast. A third 5-km-wide caldera formed about 25,000 years ago by collapse of an interglacial cone that was constructed over the glaciated surfaces of the earlier calderas. The 1018-m-high central cone of Nemo Peak is composed of two coalescing andesitic cones that were constructed at the SW side of the youngest caldera and formed in four stages beginning in the early Holocene about 9500 years ago. Construction of the central cone has left the crescent-shaped Chernoe Lake at the NE end of the youngest caldera; lava flows from Nemo Peak form the broad SW shoreline of the lake. The final activity built a lava dome that completely overtops a 350-m-wide crater and has a 150-m-wide crater at its summit. Historical eruptions of Nemo Peak date back to the early-18th century."
"Shirinki","154.980,50.200","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/022069.jpg","","The small, 3-km-wide island of Shirinki, part of a chain of volcanoes west of the main Kuril Island arc, is located 15 km west of Fuss Peak on Paramushir Island. The truncated andesitic cone is of Holocene age and rises to a height of 761 m. The walls of the 750-m-wide breached summit crater extend to the southern coast. Two lava domes were constructed near the headwall of the breached crater. No historical eruptions are known from Shirinki, but the summit domes are very young and possibly formed in historical time (Gorshkov, 1970). The remnants of an older volcano occupy the eastern side of the island, much of which is covered by pumiceous pyroclastic-fall deposits."
"Fuss Peak","155.246,50.267","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091063.jpg","","Fuss Peak in the northern Kuriles forms a peninsula that lies across a low isthmus on the SW coast of Paramushir Island. The volcano rises 2800 m from the floor of the Sea of Okhotsk to a height of 1742 m. This isolated symmetrical andesitic stratovolcano has a 700-m-wide, steep-walled crater that is 300 m deep. A deep notch cuts the NW rim of the crater to the level of the crater floor, at the head of a canyon that reaches the coast. Well-preserved lava flows occupy the middle and lower flanks, particularly on the E and SE sides. Only one unambiguous historical eruption, in 1854, is known. Reports of eruptions in 1737, 1793, 1857, and 1859 are false (Gorshkov, 1970). Murayama (1987) also listed an eruption in 1742 (only earthquakes and a tsunami are cited by Sapper, 1917) and 'smoke' emission in 1933."
"Karpinsky Group","155.373,50.148","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091062.jpg","","The Karpinsky group on southern Paramushir Island consists of three Holocene andesitic volcanic centers at the southern end of the Karpinsky Ridge. A postulated caldera is thought to have been primarily excavated by glaciers (Gorshkov, 1970). The NE cone has a crater breached to the NW that contains a small horseshoe-shaped cone and a vigorous fumarole along the NE crater wall. A lava flow originating from the cone traveled 7 km to the SE. The 1326-m southern cone forms the high point of the Karpinsky massif and fed lava flows to the SE and W. The NW cone displays hot springs and sulfur cones containing liquid sulfur that is occasionally ejected outward. A minor ash ejection following an earthquake in 1952 marked the only historical eruption."
"Chikurachki","155.461,50.324","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/091068.jpg","","Chikurachki, the highest volcano on Paramushir Island in the northern Kuriles, is actually a relatively small cone constructed on a high Pleistocene volcanic edifice. Oxidized basaltic-to-andesitic scoria deposits covering the upper part of the young cone give it a distinctive red color. Frequent basaltic plinian eruptions have occurred during the Holocene. Lava flows from 1781-m-high Chikurachki reached the sea and form capes on the NW coast; several young lava flows also emerge from beneath the scoria blanket on the eastern flank. The Tatarinov group of six volcanic centers is located immediately to the south of Chikurachki, and the Lomonosov cinder cone group, the source of an early Holocene lava flow that reached the saddle between it and Fuss Peak to the west, lies at the southern end of the N-S-trending Chikurachki-Tatarinov complex. In contrast to the frequently active Chikurachki, the Tatarinov volcanoes are extensively modified by erosion and have a more complex structure. Tephrochronology gives evidence of only one eruption in historical time from Tatarinov, although its southern cone contains a sulfur-encrusted crater with fumaroles that were active along the margin of a crater lake until 1959."
"Vernadskii Ridge","155.970,50.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104076.jpg","","The Vernadskii and Bogdanovich volcano groups on northern Paramushir island in the northern Kuriles comprise the two southernmost of three volcano groups on the Vernadskii Ridge, immediately south of the historically active Ebeko volcano group. The Vernadskii group, at the southern end of the volcanic complex, contains three centers, one of which is topped by a lava dome. The Bogdanovich group, 4-5 km to the north, is composed of five eruptive centers that have produced small cones and lava flows. Gorshkov (1970) considered that eruptive activity at both the Vernadskii and Bogdanovich volcano groups continued into the Holocene."
"Ebeko","156.014,50.686","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/022071.jpg","","The flat-topped summit of the central cone of Ebeko volcano, one of the most active in the Kuril Islands, occupies the northern end of Paramushir Island. Three summit craters located along a SSW-NNE line form Ebeko volcano proper, at the northern end of a complex of five volcanic cones. Blocky lava flows extend west from Ebeko and SE from the neighboring Nezametnyi cone. The eastern part of the southern crater contains strong solfataras and a large boiling spring. The central crater is filled by a lake about 20 m deep whose shores are lined with steaming solfataras; the northern crater lies across a narrow, low barrier from the central crater and contains a small, cold crescentic lake. Historical activity, recorded since the late-18th century, has been restricted to small-to-moderate explosive eruptions from the summit craters. Intense fumarolic activity occurs in the summit craters, on the outer flanks of the cone, and in lateral explosion craters."
"Alaid","155.565,50.861","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/022080.jpg","","The highest and northernmost volcano of the Kuril Islands, 2285-m-high Alaid is a symmetrical stratovolcano when viewed from the north, but has a 1.5-km-wide summit crater that is breached widely to the south. Alaid is the northernmost of a chain of volcanoes constructed west of the main Kuril archipelago and rises 3000 m from the floor of the Sea of Okhotsk. Numerous pyroclastic cones dot the lower flanks of basaltic to basaltic-andesite Alaid volcano, particularly on the NW and SE sides, including an offshore cone formed during the 1933-34 eruption. Strong explosive eruptions have occurred from the summit crater beginning in the 18th century. Reports of eruptions in 1770, 1789, 1821, 1829, 1843, 1848, and 1858 were considered incorrect by Gorshkov (1970). Explosive eruptions in 1790 and 1981 were among the largest in the Kuril Islands during historical time."
"Kuntomintar","154.020,48.750","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104073.jpg","","Kuntomintar is a Pleistocene andesitic stratovolcano that occupies the southern end of Shiashkotan Island in the central Kuriles. A central cone fills a 4-4.5 km caldera, whose rim is visible on the NE side. A second caldera on the west side is breached to the west. An Ainu village that reportedly was destroyed by an eruption in 1872 was later found to be located near Sinarka volcano (Gorshkov, 1970). The only known postglacial activity of Kuntomintar is continuous solfataric activity that originates near the east wall of the inner caldera and a nearby hot sulfur spring."
"Odamoisan Tebenkov","147.922,45.026","Odamoisan (also known as Tebenkov), lies in the center of Iturup Island along the E coast.

There have been no historical eruptions at Odamoisan."
"Mashkovtsev","156.720,51.100","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/104079.jpg","","Mashkovtsev, the southernmost Holocene volcano of Kamchatka (Masurenkov 1980), forms a small peninsula on the Sea of Okhotsk near the southern tip of Kamchatka. The small 503-m-high basaltic stratovolcano has a postglacial summit cone (Sviatlovsky 1959). Two Holocene basaltic cones are located to the north. The age assignments of southern Kamchatkan volcanoes primarily reflect the work of Kozhemyaka, Ogorodov, and Litasov. In cases where radiometric ages are lacking, age assignments are based primarily on a geologic or sometimes strictly morphologic basis. The complex volcanic history of this region reflects several cycles of volcanism, with frequent overprinting of young basaltic cinder cones and small stratovolcanoes on eroded Pleistocene volcanoes. In general, when several Holocene cones are superimposed on an older edifice, the volcano is classified as Holocene; a single flank Holocene cone is listed separately and the older volcano is classified as Pleistocene."
"Kambalny","156.875,51.306","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/059050.jpg","","The southernmost major stratovolcano on the Kamchatka peninsula, 2116-m-high Kambalny has a summit crater that is breached to the SE. Five Holocene cinder cones on the W and SE flanks have produced fresh-looking lava flows. Beginning about 6300 radiocarbon years ago, a series of major collapses of the edifice produced at least three debris-avalanche deposits. The last major eruption took place about 600 years ago, although younger tephra layers have been found, and an eruption was reported in 1767. Active fumarolic areas are found on the flanks of the volcano, which is located south of the massive Pauzhetka volcano-tectonic depression."

A Holocene basaltic cinder cone named Ukho, related to regional basaltic monogenetic volcanism, was constructed on the NW flank of 705-m-high Yavinsky. Ukho, whose name in Russian means 'Ear,' was formed about 6000 years ago, based on stratigraphic evidence."
"Diky Greben","156.978,51.452","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/057027.jpg","","Diky Greben is a late-stage Holocene lava-dome complex that formed in the center of the 20 x 25 km Pauzhetka caldera. This large caldera was associated with eruption of the voluminous rhyolitic Golygin ignimbrite during the late Pleistocene, about 0.443 million years ago. Both Diky Greben and the Kurile Lake caldera, immediately to the east, are Holocene volcanoes constructed within the Pauzhetka caldera. The initial eruptions of Diky Greben took place about 7600-7700 years ago, immediately following the Kurile Lake eruption. Most of the volcano, particularly the thick lava flows north and south of Nepriyatnaya Mountain, was formed during an eruption about 1600 years ago. A total of 9-10 cu km of dacitic and 2-3 cu km of andesitic lavas and tephras were erupted at this time. Two large craters and a few smaller vents were formed after this eruption."
"Kurile Lake","157.120,51.450","Kurile Lake caldera is one of the most impressive volcanic features in Kamchatka. It lies within the eastern part of the massive Pauzhetka caldera, but is considered as a separate volcanic system here. The low-rimmed Kurile Lake caldera was formed in two stages during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The first caldera-forming eruption took place about 41,500 radiocarbon years ago. The second episode of caldera formation occurred about 7600 radiocarbon years ago during one of the world's largest Holocene eruptions. A total of 140-170 cu km of material was ejected, and extensive thick pyroclastic-flow deposits from the caldera-forming eruptions blanket the countryside. Ash from the eruption, one of the world's largest during the Holocene, fell more than 1000 km away on the Asia mainland. The eruption resulted in the formation of an 8 x 14 km wide caldera, now largely filled by Kurile Lake. The steep-sided Serdtze Alaida (Heart of Alaid), which forms a small island rising 300 m from the caldera floor in the center of the lake, is a rhyodacitic lava dome that formed at the end of the caldera-forming eruption."

Central Koshelev stratovolcano, the highest peak of the volcanic massif, is Holocene in age; N- and SE-flank craters have also been active during the Holocene. Gorely, a Holocene cinder cone related to regional basaltic monogenetic volcanicm, is located about 12 km NW. The largest Holocene eruption at Koshelev took place from the eastern cone about 6500 years ago. An explosive eruption was reported at the end of the 17th century.

The modern edifice grew within a 4-km-wide caldera produced by collapse of an earlier volcano creating large debris avalanches at about the time of formation of the adjacent Kurile Lake caldera. A period of strong silicic explosive volcanism during the mid-Holocene lasted about 800 years. A series of youthful lava flows cover much of the northern flanks. Growth of the modern cone was completed about 1900 years ago, after which a long quiescent period began. The only recorded historical eruption, in 1901, produced a large 1-km-wide crater on the NE flank."
"Kell","157.350,51.650","Kell volcano is a small Holocene stratovolcano constructed within the Pizrak caldera, immediately north of Zheltovsky volcano (Masurenkov, 1980).

Kamen formed during the late Pleistocene, but activity continued into the Holocene (Melekestsev et al., 1990). A major slope failure about 1200-1300 years ago removed much of the eastern side of the volcano, producing a massive 4-6 cu km debris avalanche that traveled more than 30 km to the SE."

The modern volcano, much smaller in size than its massive neighbors Kamen and Kliuchevskoi, was formed about 4700 years ago over a late-Pleistocene lava-dome complex and an ancestral edifice built about 11,000-7000 years ago. Three periods of intensified activity have occurred during the past 3000 years. The latest period, which was preceded by a 1000-year quiescence, began with the dramatic 1955-56 eruption. This eruption, similar to that of St. Helens in 1980, produced a large horseshoe-shaped crater that was formed by collapse of the summit and an associated lateral blast. Subsequent episodic but ongoing lava-dome growth, accompanied by intermittent explosive activity and pyroclastic flows, has largely filled the 1956 crater."
"Ushkovsky","160.509,56.113","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/025005.jpg","","Ushkovsky volcano (formerly known as Plosky) is a large compound volcanic massif located at the NW end of the Kliuchevskaya volcano group.

Two glacier-clad cinder cones with large summit craters form a high point within the Ushkovsky caldera. Linear zones of cinder cones are found on the SW and NE flanks and on lowlands to the west. The younger caldera at the summit of Plosky Daljny was formed in association with the eruption of large lava flows and pyroclastic material from the Lavovy ShIsh cinder cones at the foot of the volcano about 8600 years ago. The only known historical activity was an explosive eruption from the summit cone in 1890."

Since its origin about 6000 years ago, the beautifully symmetrical, 4835-m-high basaltic stratovolcano has produced frequent moderate-volume explosive and effusive eruptions without major periods of inactivity. It rises above a saddle NE of sharp-peaked Kamen volcano and lies SE of the broad Ushkovsky massif. More than 100 flank eruptions have occurred during the past roughly 3000 years, with most lateral craters and cones occurring along radial fissures between the unconfined NE-to-SE flanks of the conical volcano between 500 m and 3600 m elevation. The morphology of the 700-m-wide summit crater has been frequently modified by historical eruptions, which have been recorded since the late-17th century. Historical eruptions have originated primarily from the summit crater, but have also included numerous major explosive and effusive eruptions from flank craters."
"Piip","167.330,55.420","Dredged rocks from the summits of volcanic cones rising from 2500 m depth to within a few hundred meters of the surface yielded fresh dacitic lavas and pumice apparently of Holocene age (Fedotov et al., 1989; Seliverstov et al., 1986). Tephrochronological studies on the Commander Islands suggest that the latest tephras from Piip volcano may be as young as a few centuries, and echograms indicate present-day gas emission from the volcano. The three steep-sided volcanic cones were constructed along a N-S trend and lie about 140-150 km from the axis of the Aleutian trench, a similar distance as other Aleutian arc volcanoes. The southern and northern cones exceed the central cone in size and have craters open to the SW about 500 and 300 m wide, respectively. A lava dome occupies the southern crater, and other domes or parasitic cones are found on the summit cones and flanks of the edifice. Vigorous gas emission from the northern cone rises about 300 m from 'black smoker' vents on the crater floor."

The steep-walled caldera, now filled by a lake, was formed during a major explosive eruption about 7000 years ago. An arcuate zone of pre-caldera flank lava domes nearly surrounds the volcano, and post-caldera domes form islands in the caldera lake. Late-stage olivine basalts were erupted along a NE-trending line in the southern part of the depression.

Severny Cherpuk, 21 km SW of Ichinsky, is a double cone that was constructed along the crest of the Sredinny Range and fed massive 1.8 cu km lava flows down both sides of the range to the NW and SE. A narrow tongue of the SE flow diverted an addition 10 km to the south, for a total distance of 22 km. Yuzhny Cherpuk, 11 km SSW of Ichinsky volcano, produced a 1.7 cu km lava flow that traveled 18 km to the south and then SE. The flow descended to 640 m elevation and dammed tributaries of the Ketachan River, producing three lakes. The two cones are sometimes considered to be satellitic cones to Ichinsky, but Pevzner et al. (2000) noted petrological distinctions that suggest an origin independent of Ichinsky. Unpublished radiocarbon ages revise those in Pevzner et al. (2000) and indicate that both cones were formed about 6500 years ago."

The Molodoy Shiveluch lava dome complex was constructed during the Holocene within the large horseshoe-shaped caldera; Holocene lava dome extrusion also took place on the flanks of Stary Shiveluch. At least 60 large eruptions have occurred during the Holocene, making it the most vigorous andesitic volcano of the Kuril-Kamchatka arc. Widespread tephra layers from these eruptions have provided valuable time markers for dating volcanic events in Kamchatka.

Many Holocene trachybasaltic or basantic cones and lava flows lie atop plateaus along the Mudan River, which also contain basanitic and tephriphonolitic rocks. Mantle xenoliths are common in Jingbo volcanic rocks. A period of major activity about 5500-5200 years ago produced extensive lava flows that covered an area of about 500 sq km."
"Longgang Group","126.500,42.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/067087.jpg","","The Longgang volcanic field covers a 1700 sq km area in Jilin Province of NE China, west of Changbaishan volcano. Basaltic and trachybasaltic lava flows cover a broad area dotted by more than 150 Quaternary cinder cones and 8 tuff rings. There is only one known cinder cone of Holocene age, Jinlongdingzi (Gold Dragon Peak). The eruption that formed the large Jinlongdingzi scoria cone and deposited tephra over a broad area to the east was radiocarbon dated at about 1600-1700 years ago."
"Changbaishan","128.080,41.980","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/067080.jpg","","Massive Changbaishan stratovolcano, also known as Baitoushan and by the Korean names of Baegdu or P'aektu-san, is a relatively poorly known, but volcanologically significant volcano straddling the China/Korea border. A 5-km-wide, 850-m-deep summit caldera is filled by scenic Lake Tianchi (Sky Lake). A large Korean-speaking population resides near the volcano on both sides of the border. The 60-km-diameter dominantly trachytic and rhyolitic volcano was constructed over the Changbaishan (Laoheidingzi) shield volcano. Satellitic cinder cones are aligned along a NNE trend. One of the world's largest known Holocene explosive eruptions took place here about 1000 CE, depositing rhyolitic and trachytic tephra as far away as northern Japan and forming in part the present caldera. Minor historical eruptions have been recorded since the 15th century."
"Xianjindao","128.000,41.330","A volcano in the Shanshu Province of North Korea, known as Xianjindao, was reported to erupt two days after an eruption at Baitoushan (Changbaishan) on the China/Korea border in 1597 (Shi et al., 1986). Other eruptions were reported in 1724 and 1898 (the latter at Sanjiangdao), but little is known about the specific location and characteristics of this reported volcano and its unconfirmed eruptions."
"Ch'uga-ryong","127.330,38.330","An area of extensive basaltic lava flows occupies a graben, the NNE-SSW-trending Ch'uga-ryong rift, that cuts diagonally across the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. One 40-km-long lava flow originated from the low Ap-san shield volcano, which has a 200-m-wide summit crater and more than 20 satellitic cones. Another voluminous late-Pleistocene lava flow is 60 km long. Alkaline basaltic lava flows at the SW portion of the rift were erupted over Precambrian sediments and igneous rocks, and were estimated by Lee (1981) to be late-Pleistocene or early Holocene in age."
"Ulreung","130.870,37.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115015.jpg","","Ulreung volcano, also known as Ullung, forms a small 10-km-wide island about 100 km east of the coast of the central Korean Peninsula. The high point on Ulreung-do (Ulreung Island) is 984-m-high Seonginbong Peak. The trachyandesitic Ulreung stratovolcano is truncated by the Nari caldera. Ulreung was the site of a major phonolitic explosive eruption at the beginning of the Holocene from Nari caldera that produced pyroclastic flows and deposited ash across the Sea of Japan (East Sea) in central Honshu."
"Halla","126.530,33.361","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/025037.jpg","","The massive Halla shield volcano forms much of the 40 x 80 km Cheju (Jeju) Island, which lies 90 km south of the Korean Peninsula. Eruptions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene built a lava plateau above the roughly 100-m-deep continental shelf on which the basaltic-to-trachytic Halla shield volcano was constructed. A 400-m-wide crater truncates the 1920-m-high summit. About 360 late-Pleistocene and Holocene basaltic parasitic cones dotting the flanks of the low-angle volcano were erupted primarily along the long axis of the ENE-WSW-trending island. Most of these are scoria cones, but about 20 along the coast of the island or offshore are Pleistocene-to-Holocene tuff rings and tuff cones, and lava domes also occur. Flank eruptions continued into historical time, with the final two taking place during the 11th century."
"Buldir","175.911,52.350","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095074.jpg","","The westernmost volcanic center of the 2500-km-long Aleutian arc, Buldir consists of the older Buldir volcano at the center of the island and the younger East Cape volcano forming the NE portion of the island. The 656 m high point of the island is a tuff cone that tops the older center. A plug dome forms the 610-m-high summit of East Cape volcano, which has two principal peaks. The youngest volcanic feature on the isolated, 4.2 x 7.2 km island is a lava dome on the SE flank of East Cape volcano. The dome was considered by Coats (1951) to be of Pleistocene age based on morphologic considerations. Smith and Shaw (1975) suggested that the volcano may have been active within the last two thousand years, however, Holocene activity is uncertain, and the volcano may have ceased activity during the Pleistocene (Motyka et al. 1993, Nye et al. 1998). The flora on Buldir is less varied than on neighboring islands, suggesting that Buldir is relatively young."
"Kiska","177.602,52.103","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085057.jpg","","Conical Kiska volcano is the westernmost historically active volcano of the 2500-km-long Aleutian arc. The volcano lies at the northern tip of the elongated Kiska Island, across a low isthmus containing East Kiska and West Kiska lakes. A 400-m-wide elliptical crater, breached to the north, caps the 1220-m-high stratovolcano. The volcano is surrounded on three sides by sea cliffs up to 450 m high and overlies an older volcanic center exposed to the south. A massive submarine debris-avalanche deposit extends 40 km to the NNW. The southern part of the NE-SW-trending island, the westernmost of the Rat Island group, has been glaciated, but all lava flows on Kiska volcano post-date the last major glaciation. Young, steep-sided blocky lava flows, primarily on the northern and SW flanks, have originated from vents at locations ranging from the summit to near sea level. A flank cinder cone and associated lava flows were erupted in 1962 at Sirius Point on the northern coast. The island contains one of the best harbors in the Aleutian Islands, but is uninhabited."
"Segula","178.136,52.015","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119096.jpg","","The 6 x 7 km island of Segula east of Kiska volcano consists of a conical stratovolcano cut by a prominent NNW-SSE-trending fissure that extends to sea level at both ends of the island. The northern end of the fissure is flooded by the sea to produce a long, narrow cove. Segula was constructed above a 100-m-deep submarine platform that extends eastward to Khvostof and Davidof islands. A submarine debris-avalanche deposit extends up to 18 km offshore to the north. The summit of Segula contains a small, poorly defined caldera that is partly overtopped on the south by a cinder cone that forms the 1153 m high point of the island and on the north by extensive lava flows that reach the NE coast along a broad front. Another lava field on the SE coast originated from a cinder cone at 300 m altitude on the SE flank. No historical eruptions are known from Segula, but Nelson (1959) considered fresh lava flows on the north flank to possibly be only a few hundred years old."
"Davidof","178.330,51.970","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094084.jpg","","Five small islands, the largest of which is Davidof, are remnants of a stratovolcano that collapsed during the late Tertiary, forming a 2.7-km-wide caldera. The islands, the highest of which reaches only 328 m above sea level, include Khvostof, Pyramid, Lopy, and Davidof. The latter three islands form the eastern rim of the mostly submarine caldera, sometimes referred to as the 'Aleutian Krakatau.' The islands were constructed above a roughly 100-m-deep submarine platform extending NW-ward to Segula Island; the floor of the caldera lies 80 m below sea level. The islands are vegetated, but lava flows are recognizable, and Smith et al. (1978) suggested a possible Holocene age for the volcano."
"Little Sitkin","178.543,51.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094082.jpg","","Diamond-shaped Little Sitkin Island is bounded by steep cliffs on the east, north, and NE sides. Little Sitkin volcano contains two nested calderas. The older, nearly circular Pleistocene caldera is 4.8 km wide, may have once contained a caldera lake, and was partially filled by a younger cone formed mostly of andesitic and dacitic lava flows. The elliptical younger caldera is 2.7 x 4 km wide; it lies within the eastern part of the older caldera and shares its eastern and southern rim. The younger caldera partially destroyed the lava cone within the first caldera and is of possible early Holocene age. Young-looking dacitic lava flows, erupted in 1828 (Kay, in Wood and Kienle 1990), issued from the central cone within the younger caldera and from a vent on the west flank outside the older caldera. Fumarolic areas are found near the western coast, along the NW margin of the older caldera, and from the summit crater down the southern flank for a 1 km distance."
"Semisopochnoi","179.580,51.930","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094092.jpg","","Semisopochnoi, the largest subaerial volcano of the western Aleutians, is 20 km wide at sea level and contains an 8-km-wide caldera. It formed as a result of collapse of a low-angle, dominantly basaltic volcano following the eruption of a large volume of dacitic pumice. The high point of the island is 1221-m-high Anvil Peak, a double-peaked late-Pleistocene cone that forms much of the island's northern part. The three-peaked 774-m-high Mount Cerberus volcano was constructed during the Holocene within the caldera. Each of the peaks contains a summit crater; lava flows on the northern flank of Cerberus appear younger than those on the southern side. Other post-caldera volcanoes include the symmetrical 855-m-high Sugarloaf Peak SSE of the caldera and Lakeshore Cone, a small cinder cone at the edge of Fenner Lake in the NE part of the caldera. Most documented historical eruptions have originated from Cerberus, although Coats (1950) considered that both Sugarloaf and Lakeshore Cone within the caldera could have been active during historical time."
"Gareloi","-178.794,51.790","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119100.jpg","","The 8 x 10 km diameter Gareloi Island, the northernmost volcano of the Delarof Group at the western end of the Andreanof Islands, consists of a stratovolcano with two summits and a SE-trending fissure. This prominent fissure was formed during an eruption in 1929 and extends from the southern summit to the sea. Steep sea cliffs that are cut into rocks of an older, eroded center are found on the SW coast, and submarine deposits of three debris avalanches produced by edifice collapse are found offshore. Young lava flows cover the older volcano from the 1573-m-high summit of Gareloi to the coast along three broad axes trending NW, ENE, and south. The 1929 eruption originated from 13 craters along a 4-km-long fissure. Phreatic explosions were followed by the ejection of glassy pumice, lapilli, scoria, and older blocks, as well as by the emission of four short, steep lava flows, one of which reached the SE coast."
"Tanaga","-178.146,51.885","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119098.jpg","","Tanaga volcano, the second largest volcanic center of the central Aleutians, is the central and highest of three youthful stratovolcanoes oriented along a roughly E-W line at the NW tip of Tanaga Island. Arcuate ridges to the east and south represent the rim of an arcuate caldera formed by collapse of an ancestral Tanaga volcano during the Pleistocene. Most Holocene eruptions originated from Tanaga volcano itself, which consists of two large cones, the western of which is the highest, constructed within a caldera whose 400-m-high rim is prominent to the SE. At the westernmost end of the Tanaga complex is conical Sajaka, a 1304-m-high double cone that may be the youngest of the three volcanoes. Sajaka One volcano collapsed during the late Holocene, producing a debris avalanche that swept into the sea, after which Sajaka Two cone was constructed within the collapse scarp."
"Takawangha","-178.006,51.873","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119099.jpg","","Takawangha is a 1449-m-high, youthful volcano with an ice-filled caldera on northern Tanaga Island, near the western end of the Andreanof Islands. Takawangha lies across a saddle from historically active Tanaga volcano to the west; older, deeply eroded volcanoes lie adjacent to Takawangha on the east. The summit of the dominantly basaltic to basaltic-andesite volcano is largely ice covered, with the exception of five Holocene craters that during the last few thousand years produced explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the lower flanks of the volcano. No historical eruptions are known from Takawangha, although radiocarbon dating indicates explosive eruptions have occurred within the past several hundred years."
"Bobrof","-177.438,51.910","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085060.jpg","","The geology and timing of volcanism on this small uninhabited 3 x 4 km island, located in the Andreanof islands 50 km west of Adak and 15 km west of Kanaga volcano, are unknown (Coats, 1956). Apparent deposits of a massive submarine debris-avalanche deposit extend offshore to the NE. Smith et al. (1978) considered Bobrof to be of possible Holocene age. Andesitic pyroclastic-flow deposits are present on the 738-m-high volcano."
"Kanaga","-177.168,51.923","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095052.jpg","","Symmetrical Kanaga stratovolcano is situated within the Kanaton caldera at the northern tip of Kanaga Island. The caldera rim forms a 760-m-high arcuate ridge south and east of Kanaga; a lake occupies part of the SE caldera floor. The volume of subaerial dacitic tuff is smaller than would typically be associated with caldera collapse, and deposits of a massive submarine debris avalanche associated with edifice collapse extend nearly 30 km to the NNW. Several fresh lava flows from historical or late prehistorical time descend the flanks of Kanaga, in some cases to the sea. Historical eruptions, most of which are poorly documented, have been recorded since 1763. Kanaga is also noted petrologically for ultramafic inclusions within an outcrop of alkaline basalt SW of the volcano. Fumarolic activity occurs in a circular, 200-m-wide, 60-m-deep summit crater and produces vapor plumes sometimes seen on clear days from Adak, 50 km to the east."
"Moffett","-176.747,51.944","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085042.jpg","","Rising above Adak, the largest town of the Aleutians, Mount Moffett is a modest-sized, eroded stratovolcano with several flank lava domes. The summit cone has been largely destroyed by glacial erosion, and has been filled by an andesitic plug dome. Five other lava domes are scattered over the flanks of the volcano. The south flank lava dome is one of the youngest features of the northern Adak Island volcanoes. The Heart Lake lava flow west of Sweeper Cove on the SE side of the volcano is another young volcanic feature. Several Holocene ash layers on Adak Island have been attributed to Moffett volcano. Its proximity to Adak Naval Air Station makes this one of the most accessible of the Aleutian volcanoes. Kiguga Warm Springs are located at Cape Kiguga, west of Mount Moffet, and the northern part of Adak Island has been investigated for geothermal power production."
"Great Sitkin","-176.130,52.076","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085062.jpg","","Constructed within the caldera of an older shield volcano forming the northern half of Great Sitkin Island, 1740-m-high Great Sitkin volcano contains a small, 0.8 x 1.2 km ice-filled summit caldera. Deep glacial valleys radiate from the summit, which lies at the eastern rim of the caldera, which was formed by massive edifice failure that produced a submarine debris avalanche that traveled more than 40 km to the north. The entire island is blanketed with a light-brown to black pumice layer up to 6 m thick. This deposit is overlain over much of the NW side of the island by ash deposits from a subsidiary vent NW of the caldera. Hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles occur near the head of Big Fox Creek, south of the volcano. Historical eruptions have been recorded since the late-19th century. In 1945, a 400-600 m wide, flat-topped lava dome was emplaced through a glacier filling the steep-sided, 180-m-deep summit caldera."
"Kasatochi","-175.508,52.177","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085063.jpg","","Located at the northern end of a shallow submarine ridge trending perpendicular to the Aleutian arc, Kasatochi is small 2.7 x 3.3 km wide island volcano with a dramatic 750-m-wide summit crater lake. The summit of Kasatochi reaches only 314 m above sea level, and the lake surface lies less than about 60 m above the sea. A lava dome is located on the NW flank at about 150 m elevation. The asymmetrical island is steeper on the northern side than the southern, and the volcano's crater lies north of the center of the island. Reports of activity from the heavily eroded Koniuji volcano to the east probably refer to eruptions from Kasatochi. A lava flow may have been emplaced during the first historical eruption in 1760. A major explosive eruption in 2008 produced pyroclastic flows and surges that swept into the sea, extending the island's shoreline."
"Koniuji","-175.130,52.220","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095088.jpg","","The very small, 1 x 1.5 km wide Koniuji Island, located between Atka and Kasatochi volcanoes, is the emergent top of a mostly submarine volcano. The summit of the mostly submerged volcano reaches only 273 m above sea level. The volcano, which lies about 20 km north of the western side of Atka Island, is deeply dissected, with a steep, arcuate cliff on the west. New argon-argon dating indicates that the island emerged above sea level aout 15,000 years ago, and that several lava flows and domes were erupted during the Holocene. The summit lava dome is younger than about 3000 years. Reports of historical eruptive activity may be erroneous and are considered to refer to eruptions of the relatively undissected Kasatochi volcano to the west."
"Sergief","-174.950,52.050","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114087.jpg","","Sergief is a small stratovolcano on SW Atka Island whose age is poorly known. The SW part of the island is older and less topographically rugged than the NE part of the island. Sergief was tentatively listed as a young volcano in the Post-Miocene Volcanoes of the World catalog of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (1973), but the age of its latest eruption is not precisely known."
"Atka","-174.139,52.331","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120046.jpg","","The largest volcanic center in the central Aleutians, Atka consists of a central shield and Pleistocene caldera with several post-caldera volcanoes. A major dacitic explosive eruption accompanied formation of the caldera about 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. The most prominent of the post-caldera stratovolcanoes are Kliuchef and Sarichef, both of which may have been active in historical time. Sarichef has a symmetrical profile, but the less eroded Kliuchef is the source of most if not all historical eruptions. Kliuchef may have been active on occasion simultaneously with Korovin volcano to the north. Hot springs and fumaroles are located on the flanks of Mount Kliuchef and in a glacial valley SW of Kliuchef."
"Korovin","-174.166,52.381","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095027.jpg","","Korovin, the most frequently active volcano of the large volcanic complex at the NE tip of Atka Island, contains a 1533-m-high double summit with two craters located along a NW-SE line. The NW summit has a small crater, but the 1-km-wide crater of the SE cone has an unusual, open cylindrical vent of widely variable depth that sometimes contains a crater lake or a high magma column. A fresh-looking cinder cone lies on the flank of partially dissected Konia volcano, located on the SE flank. The volcano is dominantly basaltic in composition, although some late-stage dacitic lava flows are present on both Korovin and Konia."
"Seguam","-172.510,52.315","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094069.jpg","","The elliptical, 11.5 x 24 km island of Seguam, lying between Amlia and Amukta Islands in the central Aleutians, contains two calderas with Holocene post-caldera cones. Growth of the basaltic-to-rhyolitic Wilcox volcano on the east side of the island during the late Pleistocene was followed by edifice collapse and an associated ignimbrite eruption about 9000 years ago, leaving a horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the west, inside which a rhyolitic cone was constructed. The 3 x 4 km wide westernmost caldera has a central scoria cone, Pyre Peak, which rises above the caldera rim and is the source of most of the historical eruptions of Seguam volcano. A very young basaltic field surrounds Pyre Peak, and lava flows partially fill the caldera and reach the southern coast. Older Holocene lava flows were erupted from vents within the eastern caldera, and a monogenetic Holocene cone forms Moundhill volcano on the eastern tip of the island."
"Amukta","-171.252,52.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085053.jpg","","The symmetrical Amukta stratovolcano lies in the central Aleutians SW of Chagulak Island and is the westernmost of the Islands of the Four Mountains group. Amukta was constructed at the northern side of an arcuate caldera-like feature that is open to the sea along the southern coast of the 8-km-wide Amukta Island. The 1066-m-high stratovolcano overlies a broad shield volcano and is topped by a 400-m-wide crater. A cinder cone is located near the NE coast. Amukta has had several eruptions in historical time from both summit and flank vents."

The two volcanoes coalesce at depth although they are separated by 7 km of ocean. Yunaska volcano lies about 20 km to the east. Sharp-topped Chagulak volcano rises steeply to 1142 m and is ruggedly dissected on the east side. No historical eruptions have been recorded from Chagulak volcano, and its age is not precisely known."
"Yunaska","-170.629,52.643","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095039.jpg","","The elongated, 9 x 23 km island of Yunaska in the Islands of the Four Mountains group is comprised of two unnamed volcanic centers of greatly different morphology. The older, 950-m-high western center consists of the eroded remnants of four overlapping stratovolcanoes that form a linear, NNE-trending ridge. Cinder cones and fissure-fed lava flows extend from the western end of the complex. The younger, 550-m-high eastern complex consists of a shield volcano capped by two nested calderas. The 3.5-km-wide Coats caldera is located within an older 10 x 13 km caldera and contains cinder cones and a lava field. Two areas of particularly youthful lava flows extend down the flank through a gap in the SW caldera rim and blanket the upper northern flank of the caldera. Vents are found on the flanks of the caldera within a kilometer of its rim. A post-caldera cone is capped by a small summit crater. The eastern center is presumably the source of the island's historical eruptions, first recorded in 1817."
"Herbert","-170.111,52.742","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045056.jpg","","The 10-km-wide Herbert Island, the SW-most of the Islands of the Four Mountains group, lies across a strait SW of Mount Cleveland. Herbert is a classic, symmetrical stratovolcano whose summit is broadly truncated by a 2-km-wide caldera that is breached to NW. No historical eruptions have been recorded from 1280-m-high Herbert volcano, which, like many other Aleutian volcanoes, has not been studied geologically."
"Carlisle","-170.054,52.894","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/093064.jpg","","Carlisle Island is a steep-sided, conical stratovolcano that rises to 1620 m across the Carlisle Pass strait from Mount Cleveland. Radar images suggest that this uninhabited, 7-km-wide island may contain two closely spaced volcanic cones (Myers, in Wood and Kienle 1990). Like nearby Herbert volcano, no geologic studies have been conducted on the volcano. Eruptions from Carlisle have been reported since the 18th century, but are very poorly documented. A variety of names was attached to Carlisle on early hydrographic maps, and Miller et al. (1998) noted that some 18th and 19th century eruptions reported at the closely spaced volcanoes of the 'Islands of the Four Mountains' area could refer to Carlisle as well as Cleveland, Uliaga, or Kagamil volcanoes."

It lies SE across Carlisle Pass strait from Carlisle volcano and NE across Chuginadak Pass strait from Herbert volcano. Cleveland is joined to the rest of Chuginadak Island by a low isthmus. The 1730-m-high Mount Cleveland is the highest of the Islands of the Four Mountains group and is one of the most active of the Aleutian Islands. The native name for Mount Cleveland, Chuginadak, refers to the Aleut goddess of fire, who was thought to reside on the volcano. Numerous large lava flows descend the steep-sided flanks. It is possible that some 18th-to-19th century eruptions attributed to Carlisle should be ascribed to Cleveland (Miller et al., 1998). In 1944 Cleveland produced the only known fatality from an Aleutian eruption. Recent eruptions have been characterized by short-lived explosive ash emissions, at times accompanied by lava fountaining and lava flows down the flanks."
"Tana","-169.770,52.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118060.jpg","","The Tana volcanic complex forming the eastern half of the dumbbell-shaped Chuginadak Island, opposite the dramatic conical Cleveland stratovolcano, is composed of two prominent E-W-trending volcanoes. The complex shows evidence of glacial erosion, but the observation on satellite imagery of highly irregular coastlines forming peninsulas west of Applegate Cove on the NW side of the complex and Concord Point on the south side imply lava flows of mid- to late-Holocene age (Nye 2007, pers. comm.). Prominent lava flow levees are visible near Concord Point, where a low-silica rhyolite sample was obtained. The undissected cone and youthful crater forming the western summit also imply a post-glacial age, and youthful cinder cones also lie east of the isthmus between Cleveland and Tana volcanoes."

Uliaga volcano rises to only 888 m and is the smallest of the Islands of the Four Mountains volcanoes. There are no reports of historical eruptions from Uliaga, but the volcano was considered to have been active during the Holocene (Nye et al., 1998)."

The southern half of 5 x 10 km Kagamil Island contains two undissected cones of postglacial age with small summit craters. The larger, 893-m-high cone is located at the SE end of the NNW-SSE-trending volcano. Arcuate ridges at the northern and southern ends of the island suggest a possible earlier caldera. Hot springs and fumaroles occur along a steaming beach at the SE coast. The early explorer Veniaminof (1840) indicated that Kagamil formerly 'flamed and smoked,' but the only eruptive report is of unspecified activity in 1929 (Coats 1950)."

Vsevidof contains a 1.2-km-wide, ice-filled summit crater that is breached by glaciers on the east and north sides. An E-W-trending zone of scoria cones that extends from 1220 m down much of the western flank has been the source of historical eruptions. The bulk of the 2149-m-high cone of Vsevidof was constructed during the Holocene.

Recheschnoi consists of an elongated, NE-SW-trending ridge that is dissected by deep glacier-filled valleys. Erosion is more extensive at the NE end. Holocene andesitic pyroclastic cones and rhyolitic lava domes, the latter west of the head of Russian Bay, are situated on the east and west flanks of the volcano. The Geyser Bight geothermal area on the NE flank of Recheschnoi is one of the hottest and most extensive thermal areas in Alaska. It consists of six zones of thermal springs and two fumarolic areas along upper Geyser Creek and contains the only known geysers in the state. Other thermal areas occur at Hot Springs Cove and Partov Cove on the rugged isthmus between Recheschnoi and Okmok volcanoes."
"Okmok","-168.130,53.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/053086.jpg","","The broad, basaltic Okmok shield volcano, which forms the NE end of Umnak Island, has a dramatically different profile than most other Aleutian volcanoes. The summit of the low, 35-km-wide volcano is cut by two overlapping 10-km-wide calderas formed during eruptions about 12,000 and 2050 years ago that produced dacitic pyroclastic flows that reached the coast. More than 60 tephra layers from Okmok have been found overlying the 12,000-year-old caldera-forming tephra layer. Numerous satellitic cones and lava domes dot the flanks of the volcano down to the coast, including 1253-m Mount Tulik on the SE flank, which is almost 200 m higher than the caldera rim. Some of the post-caldera cones show evidence of wave-cut lake terraces; the more recent cones, some of which have been active historically, were formed after the caldera lake, once 150 m deep, disappeared. Hot springs and fumaroles are found within the caldera. Historical eruptions have occurred since 1805 from cinder cones within the caldera."

It rises 1500 m above the Bering Sea floor. Repeated construction and destruction of lava domes at different locations during historical time has greatly modified the appearance of this 'Jack-in-the-Box' volcano and has introduced a confusing nomenclature applied during frequent visits of exploring expeditions. The present triangular-shaped, 0.75 x 2 km island consists of remnants of lava domes emplaced from 1796 to 1992. Castle Rock (Old Bogoslof) is a steep-sided pinnacle that is a remnant of a spine from the 1796 eruption. Fire Island (New Bogoslof), a small island located about 600 m NW of Bogoslof Island, is a remnant of a lava dome that was formed in 1883."

The broad, domical structure of Makushin contrasts with the steep-sided profiles of most other Aleutian stratovolcanoes. Much of the volcano was formed during the Pleistocene, but the caldera (which formed about 8000 years ago), Sugarloaf cone on the ENE flank, and a cluster of about a dozen explosion pits and cinder cones at Point Kadin on the WNW flank, are of Holocene age. A broad band of NE-SW-trending satellitic vents cuts across the volcano. The composite Pakushin cone, with multiple summit craters, lies 8 km to the SW of Makushin. Frequent explosive eruptions have occurred during the past 4000 years, sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges. Geothermal areas are found in the summit caldera of Makushin and on the SE and eastern flanks of the volcano. They represent the largest and most investigated high-temperature geothermal resources in Alaska. Small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded at Makushin since 1786."

An older, largely buried caldera was formed during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Two volcanic centers are located on the NW flank. Lava Peak is of Pleistocene age, and a cinder cone lower on the flank produced a lava flow in 1852 that extended the shoreline of the island and forms Lava Point. The 60-365 m deep younger caldera was formed during a major explosive eruption about 1600 years ago and contains at least three lakes. The currently active large cinder cone in the NE part of the caldera has been the source of frequent explosive eruptions with occasional lava effusion that blankets the caldera floor. A lava flow in 1978 traveled through a narrow breach in the north caldera rim almost to the coast.

The broad volcano has a somewhat of a shield-like morphology and forms one of the largest volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands. The sharp-topped, conical Pogromni stratovolcano lies 5 km north of Westdahl. Pogromni rises to 2002 m, several hundred meters higher than Westdahl, but is moderately glacially dissected and presumably older. Many satellitic cones of postglacial age are located along a NW-SE line cutting across the summit of Westdahl. Some of the historical eruptions attributed to the eroded Pogromni volcano may have originated instead from Westdahl (Miller et al. 1998). The first historical eruption of Westdahl occurred in 1795.

The Aleuts named the volcano Sisquk, meaning 'mountain which points the way when I am lost.' A steady steam plume rises from its small summit crater. Constructed atop an older glacially dissected volcano, it is Holocene in age and largely basaltic in composition. Remnants of an older ancestral volcano are exposed on the west and NE sides at 1500-1800 m elevation. There are over two dozen pyroclastic cones on its NW flank, which is blanketed by massive aa lava flows.

Adagdak consists of a small stratovolcano capping an older shield volcano exposed on the southern side of the complex. An andesitic lava dome fills the summit crater. A late-stage basaltic lava dome was constructed on the SE flank, and a phreatic vent is located on the western flank of the shield volcano. The most recent eruptions have been considered to be Holocene (Marsh, in Wood and Kienle 1990) or Pleistocene (Motyka et al. 1993, Nye et al. 1998). Three stages of volcanism were mapped by Bratten, the youngest of which was a lava dome dated at about 0.21 million years (AVO, 2005-). The older Andrew Bay volcano, located north of Andrew Lagoon between Adagdak and Moffett volcanoes, is preserved only in erosional remnants.

A third cone, Little Pavlof, is a smaller volcano on the SW flank of Pavlof volcano, near the rim of Emmons Lake caldera. Unlike Pavlof Sister, Pavlof has been frequently active in historical time, typically producing Strombolian to Vulcanian explosive eruptions from the summit vents and occasional lava flows. The active vents lie near the summit on the north and east sides. The largest historical eruption took place in 1911, at the end of a 5-year-long eruptive episode, when a fissure opened on the N flank, ejecting large blocks and issuing lava flows."

Pavlof Sister, along with Pavlof and Little Pavlof is a stratovolcano that formed outside of the Emmons Lake caldera; these and other volcanoes inside Emmons Lake caldera are not glaciated and thus would have formed since the area was last glaciated about 15-20,000 years ago. The 2142-m-high volcano is almost 400 m lower than Pavlof and has a sharper-peaked summit. Some sources attributed a period of intermittent eruptive activity from 1762 to 1786 CE to Pavlof Sister, but other sources consider this event to have been from Pavlof volcano.

The central summit consists of a lava dome, while the east, SW, and north volcanoes are capped by fragmental cones with ice-filled craters. The three westernmost summits are glaciated and of primarily Pleistocene age, but the East Mageik summit cone was the source of at least six Holocene eruptive episodes and fed Holocene lava flows that descended toward Katmai Pass and blanket the NE-to-SE flanks of the volcano. A young, 300-m-wide explosion crater between the east and central summits that formed about 2400-2500 years ago contains a shallow, acidic lake and many superheated fumarole jets. Three Holocene debris avalanches from south-flank failures descended into the Martin Creek drainages, one perhaps reaching the coast. Reports of historical eruptions from Mageik were questioned by Miller et al. (1998) and Hildreth and Fierstein (2000)."
"Trident","-155.100,58.236","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/053013.jpg","","The Trident stratovolcano cluster was named for the three prominent peaks that were the most visible features at the summit prior to 1953. The andesitic-dacitic group consists of four overlapping stratovolcanoes and numerous flank lava domes, including Falling Mountain and Mt. Cerberus on the far west flank. The summit complex is located 3-5 km SE of Novarupta volcano, and merges along a ridge to the NE with Katmai. The three oldest Trident volcanoes are glaciated and Pleistocene in age, while the youngest, Southwest Trident, was formed during historical time. Eruptions migrated through time from the NE to the SW. In 1953 a new lava dome began growing on the SW flank of Trident I volcano. A series of thick andesitic lava flows were erupted between 1953 and 1968, forming a cone with 400-800 m of local relief. Periodic explosions took place until 1974, and the current summit contains a 350-m-wide crater. Some of the distal lava flows from West Trident stratovolcano collapsed into the Novarupta vent during its 1912 eruption."
"Katmai","-154.963,58.280","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/053008.jpg","http://www.avo.alaska.edu/webcam/Katmai.php","Prior to 1912, Mount Katmai was a compound stratovolcano with four NE-SW-trending summits, most of which were truncated by caldera collapse in that year. Two or more large explosive eruptions took place from Mount Katmai during the late Pleistocene. Most of the two overlapping pre-1912 Katmai volcanoes are Pleistocene in age, but Holocene lava flows from a flank vent descend the SE flank of the SW stratovolcano into the Katmai River canyon. Katmai was initially considered to be the source of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes ash flow in 1912. However, the 3 x 4 km wide caldera of 1912 is now known to have formed as a result of the voluminous eruption at nearby Novarupta volcano. The steep walled young caldera has a jagged rim that rises 500-1000 m above the caldera floor and contains a 250-m-deep, still-rising lake. Lake waters have covered a small post-collapse lava dome (Horseshoe Island) that was seen on the caldera floor at the time of the initial ascent to the caldera rim in 1916. Post-1912 glaciers have formed on a bench within Katmai caldera."
"Novarupta","-155.157,58.270","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/053015.jpg","","Novarupta, the least topographically prominent volcano in the Katmai area, was formed during a major eruption in 1912. This eruption was the world's largest during the 20th century and produced a voluminous rhyolitic airfall tephra and the renowned Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (VTTS) ash flow. At the end of the eruption a small, 65-m-high, 400-m-wide lava dome grew to an elevation of 841 m within the source vent of the VTTS ashflow, a 2-km-wide area of subsidence NW of Trident volcano. The NE side of the Falling Mountain lava dome of the Trident volcanic cluster, as well as Broken Mountain and Baked Mountain, was removed by collapse of the Novarupta depression, which is marked by radial and scalloped arcuate fractures. Much larger collapse took place at Katmai volcano, 10 km to the east, where a 3 x 4 km wide caldera formed in response to magma reservoir drainage toward Novarupta."
"Griggs","-155.092,58.354","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/053021.jpg","","The summit of Mount Griggs towers above Knife Creek on the NE side of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The volcano is uniquely offset west of the NE-trending alignment of volcanoes in the Katmai area. The broad, 2317-m-high stratovolcano, formerly known as Knife Peak, consists of a late-Pleistocene volcano with glacial valleys on the north that was truncated on its SW side by an early Holocene edifice collapse. A Holocene volcano was subsequently constructed within the 1.5-km-wide scarp left by the emplacement of a large SW-flank debris avalanche. Nested cones with three concentric craters mostly fill the scarp, and thick, blocky lava flows blanket the SW flanks of the volcano below the collapse scarp. In contrast to the more silicic centers of the Katmai area along the crest of the range, lava flows from Griggs are dominantly andesitic in composition, and dacitic lava flows are uncommon. No historical eruptions have occurred from Griggs, but noisy fumarolic jets near the summit can be heard from the valley floor, 1750 m below."

More than 90% of the compound Snowy volcano is mantled by glacial ice, which prompted the naming of the volcano by members of the 1917 Katmai expedition. Two small andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes, SW Snowy and NE Snowy, originated about 200,000 years ago. Only NE Snowy has been active during the Holocene. Late-Holocene collapse of this volcano produced a large debris avalanche that traveled to the north and left a large breached crater inside which a blocky lava dome was constructed. Peat beneath an ash layer thought to be associated with the the lava dome was radiocarbon dated at about 250 +/- 70 years ago. No historical eruptive activity has been documented, but fumarolic activity has been observed at NE Snowy. A zone of persistent diffuse shallow seismicity is located on and NW of the volcano."

This poorly known section of Katmai National Park contains a cluster of four closely spaced and mostly ice-covered vents. Mount Denison lies at the SW end of this volcanic chain, which also includes Steller, Kukak, and Devils Desk volcanoes. Orientation of lava flows and a thick cross-bedded tephra deposit suggest that a vent is located near Mount Denison (Swanson, in Wood and Kienle 1990). The precise age of the most recent activity at Denison is not known."

The precise age of the most recent activity at Steller volcano is not known, but the volcano was considered to have been active during the Holocene (Nye et al., 1998)."
"Kukak","-154.355,58.453","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085064.jpg","","The almost completely ice-covered Kukak volcano lies west of Hallo Bay near the NE end of a glacier-mantled range extending from Mount Katmai. Kukak volcano contains a vigorous fumarole field at the southern base of the hydrothermally altered northern summit and is the only one of the Denison-Steller-Kukak chain of volcanoes to display geothermal activity. Two reports of historical eruptions at Kukak from Hantke (1959) appear to be erroneous. The report of a 1951 eruption is an apparent reference to a July 22, 1951 ashfall at Kukak Bay, which was attributed by Muller et al. (1954) to Martin volcano. A 1953 explosive 'eruption' was single large puff of steam followed by steaming from caverns in Hook Glacier (Muller et al., 1954)."

Though only 901 m high, the volcano rises directly from lowland areas near sea level south of the Big River. Initially considered to be a typical stratovolcano truncated by a caldera, the pre-caldera edifice has been shown to consist of nine contiguous late-Pleistocene lava dome clusters, most of which lie east of the present caldera. A large post-caldera lava dome extends into the lake on the SW side and another dome forms a small island in the center of the lake. The youthful caldera is unglaciated, and distal tephras from the caldera-forming eruption have been radiocarbon dated at about 5800 years before present. Voluminous dacitic pyroclastic-flow deposits surround the caldera and reached Shelikof Strait to the SE."

The orientation of andesitic lava flows and extensive hydrothermal alteration of rocks near the present 2105-m-high summit suggest that it probably marks the vent of Fourpeaked volcano. Eruptive activity during the Holocene had not been confirmed prior to the first historical eruption of Fourpeaked in September 2006.

The volcano, the NE-most in Katmai National Park, contains a small, ice-free summit crater lake and an active fumarole field. The volcano was constructed above Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary rocks. A lake temperature of 25 degrees Centigrade and a pH of 1 were measured in 1982. The fumaroles, which are actively depositing sulfur, were all at the pressure boiling point in 1982 and heated up to 114-118 degrees in 1991. The fumaroles are located on the NE wall of the 160 x 200 m wide crater lake; some fumaroles are subaqueous and produce turbulence on the surface of the blue-green lake. Unglaciated and relatively uneroded lava flows are found on the NW flank of the volcano. The age of the most recent eruptions from Douglas is not known, but Nye et al.

It consists of a complex of overlapping summit lava domes surrounded by an apron of volcaniclastic debris that descends to the sea on all sides. Few lava flows are exposed; the flanks consist mainly of debris-avalanche and pyroclastic-flow deposits formed by repeated collapse and regrowth of the volcano's summit. The latest episode of edifice collapse occurred during Augustine's largest historical eruption in 1883; subsequent dome growth has restored the volcano to a height comparable to that prior to 1883. The oldest dated volcanic rocks on Augustine are more than 40,000 years old. At least 11 large debris avalanches have reached the sea during the past 1800-2000 years, and five major pumiceous tephras have been erupted during this interval. Historical eruptions have typically consisted of explosive activity with emplacement of pumiceous pyroclastic-flow deposits followed by lava dome extrusion with associated block-and-ash flows."

The Johnson Glacier dome complex lies on the NE flank. Steep headwalls on the southern and eastern flanks expose an inaccessible cross-section of the volcano. Major glaciers radiate from the summit, and valleys below the summit contain debris-avalanche and lahar deposits. Only a few major Holocene explosive eruptions have occurred from the deeply dissected volcano, which lacks a distinct crater. Most of the reports of historical eruptions may represent plumes from vigorous fumaroles east and SE of the summit, which are often mistaken for eruption columns (Miller et al., 1998). Eruptions producing pyroclastic flows have been dated at as recent as about 300 and 140 years ago (into the historical period), and elevated seismicity accompanying dike emplacement beneath the volcano was recorded in 1996."

Next to Mount Spurr, Redoubt has been the most active Holocene volcano in the upper Cook Inlet. The volcano was constructed beginning about 890,000 years ago over Mesozoic granitic rocks of the Alaska-Aleutian Range batholith. Collapse of the summit of Redoubt 10,500-13,000 years ago produced a major debris avalanche that reached Cook Inlet. Holocene activity has included the emplacement of a large debris avalanche and clay-rich lahars that dammed Lake Crescent on the south side and reached Cook Inlet about 3500 years ago. Eruptions during the past few centuries have affected only the Drift River drainage on the north. Historical eruptions have originated from a vent at the north end of the 1.8-km-wide breached summit crater. The 1989-90 eruption of Redoubt had severe economic impact on the Cook Inlet region and affected air traffic far beyond the volcano."

The caldera was formed by a late-Pleistocene or early Holocene debris avalanche and associated pyroclastic flows that destroyed an ancestral Spurr volcano. The debris avalanche traveled more than 25 km to the SE, and the resulting deposit contains blocks as large as 100 m in diameter. Several ice-carved post-caldera cones or lava domes lie in the center of the caldera.

The most widely exposed lava flows originated from E-W-trending vents in the Bogoslof Hill area in the center of the island and a NE-trending row of cinder cones in the Rush Hill area at the west side of the island. Subaerial activity at St. Paul began about 540,000 years ago and produced a basaltic lava platform. Later eruptions produced a series of monogenetic vents and two small shield volcanoes. Bogoslof Hill in the center of the island and Hutchinson Hill, forming isolated Northeast Point, which is connected by a low narrow isthmus to the rest of the island, were formed during the Pleistocene.

Lava flows at the outlet of Lake Grace near Behm Canal on the eastern side of Revillagigedo Island were considered to be of late-Pleistocene or Holocene age (Wanek and Callahan 1971). Minor andesitic and trachyandesitic flows are also present."
"Fort Selkirk","-137.380,62.930","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101049.jpg","","The Fort Selkirk volcanic field near the junction of the Yukon and Pelly rivers in central Yukon is the northernmost Holocene volcanic field in Canada. It consists of a sequence of valley filling alkaline olivine basalt and basanitic lava flows succeeded by construction of three nephelinitic pyroclastic cones and lava flow aprons. The Ne Ch'e Ddhawa pyroclastic cone (Wootten's Cone) is composed primarily of hyaloclastite tuffs, breccias, and pillow breccias erupted subglacially during the late Pleistocene (Jackson, 1989). The youngest cone, Volcano Mountain, produced young nephelinitic lava flows that remain unvegetated and appear to be only a few hundred years old. However, dating of sediments in a lake impounded by the lava flows indicated that the youngest flows could not be younger than mid-Holocene and could be early Holocene or older (Jackson and Stevens, 1992)."
"Alligator Lake","-135.420,60.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115043.jpg","","A group of basaltic cones and lava flows (the Miles Canyon basalts) in south-central Yukon near the capital city of Whitehorse was considered to be of Pleistocene age (Wheeler, 1961). The upper part of the Alligator Lake volcanic complex, consisting of two well-preserved cinder cones capping a small shield volcano, probably post-dates local Holocene glaciation (Eiche et al., 1987). Lava flows from both cones traveled to the north and were erupted simultaneously. Their compositions range from alkali olivine basalt to basanitic. Flows from the NE cone are the largest, extending 6 km from the cone and expanding to a width of 10 km at the terminus. Portions of the flows contain spinel lherzolite and granitoid xenoliths and megacrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and spinel."
"Atlin Volcanic Field","-133.320,59.680","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096039.jpg","","A group of late-Pleistocene to Holocene cinder cones lies on the Teslin Plateau in NW-most British Columbia, east of Atlin Lake. The largest volcanic feature is 1880-m-high Ruby Mountain (named for the brilliantly colored tephra deposits at its summit and flanks), which has been partially dissected by Pleistocene and post-Wisconsin glaciation. Two basaltic cinder cones at the heads of Cracker and Volcanic Creeks lie within glacially dissected U-shaped valleys and were considered to be of postglacial age (Edwards et al., 1996). Placer miners working in the region at the end of the 19th century reported an eruption from the Ruby Mountain area about 80 km south of Gladys Lake (Hickson et al., 1994; Edwards et al., 1996) during which ashfall was reported for several days and the miners were able to work at nights due to incandescent glow from the eruption. No field evidence has been found, however, for a volcanic cone or lava flow in the Atlin area young enough to have been the product of an historical eruption, and the report is considered uncertain."
"Tuya Volcanic Field","-130.580,59.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109086.jpg","","A broad region dotted with formerly subglacial volcanic cones known as tuyas forms the Tuya volcanic field near Tuya Lake and a broad area to the north. Although tuyas, the products of Pleistocene subglacial eruptions, are perhaps more well-known in Iceland, these predominantly flat-topped basaltic table mountains derive their name from the Tuya region in the Cassiar Mountains and Tanzilla Plateau area of northern British Columbia. Tuya Butte itself, immediately north of Tuya Lake, has no summit crater or obvious vent, suggesting fissure-fed eruptions, although several indications suggest a vent location near a large cirque on the north face. Other tuyas lie in the High Tuya Lake, Iverson Creek, Rancheria River, and Klinkit Lake areas. Several small subaerial shield volcanoes, and postglacial lapilli cones and lava flows have been reported in this area. At least one of these, Grabrielse Cone near the headwaters of Iverson Creek, is of Holocene age."
"Heart Peaks","-131.970,58.600","The late-Cenozoic Heart Peaks shield volcano, located NW of Level Mountain in NW British Columbia, is capped by rhyolitic lava domes. The basal shield rises roughly 900 m above local topography and is composed of flat-lying basaltic and trachybasaltic lava flows and pyroclastics. The most recent eruptive activity at Heart Peak is of dominantly Pleistocene age, and late-stage Holocene activity is uncertain (Edwards and Russell, 2000; Edwards 2004, pers. comm.). The shield volcano rises above the Heart Peaks Plateau, which is sculpted on all sides by tributaries of the Inklin River. The colorful bright green and pink, steep-sided lava domes of the Heart Peaks Formation are formed of porphyritic rhyolitic and minor trachytic rocks and occupy the western side of the plateau."
"Level Mountain","-131.350,58.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101053.jpg","","Level Mountain volcano is the most voluminous and most persistent eruptive center of the Stikine volcanic belt in NW British Columbia. The massive volcano covers an area of 1800 sq km SW of Dease Lake and north of Telegraph Creek. An 860 cu km bimodal, Miocene-to-Pliocene stratovolcano with several eruptive centers caps a Miocene basaltic shield volcano. Following extensive glacial dissection and emplacement of late-Pliocene silicic lava domes, lesser activity continued into the Quaternary. More than 20 Tertiary-to-Holocene eruptive centers have been identified in the central portion of Level Mountain and on its flanks. The broad, dissected summit region consists of trachytic and rhyolitic lava domes and was considered to be dotted with several minor basaltic vents of postglacial age (Hamilton and Scafe, 1977), although Edwards and Russell (2000) considered Holocene activity to be uncertain."
"Edziza","-130.630,57.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101055.jpg","","The composite felsic stratovolcano Mount Edziza and associated satellitic lava domes and pyroclastic cones were constructed over the past 7.5 million years during five magmatic cycles beginning with eruption of alkali basalts and ending with felsic and basaltic eruptions as late about 1000 years ago. The 7.5 million-year-old (Ma) Armadillo Peak stratovolcano at the south end of the complex is overlapped by the Ice Peak central volcano, which was formed during the early Pleistocene, and contains a caldera largely destroyed by glaciers. The Mount Edziza stratovolcano on the north was formed about 1.0-0.9 Ma. A 2-km-wide, ice-filled caldera truncates its summit; lava domes were subsequently emplaced around its periphery and lava lakes ponded within the caldera and overflowed its rim. Numerous ice-contact features and products of subglacial eruptions are found in the Mount Edziza complex. More than 30 Holocene pyroclastic cones, primarily of basaltic composition, are located on Mount Edziza and the adjacent Spectrum Range, some of which are younger than about 1300 years before present. Large areas of Holocene lava flows of the postglacial Big Raven Formation are located north of Mount Edziza, forming the Desolation Lava Field, and south and SW of Ice Peak, forming the Snowshoe Lava Field."

A predominately rhyolitic lava dome complex overlies a basal basaltic shield volcano in the Spectrum Range, named for its extensive colorful solfataric alteration. The Pliocene Spectrum Range center contains Pleistocene subglacial and subaerial cones on the SW flank and Holocene pyroclastic cones and lava flows on the NW and SW sides. The Mess Lake Lava Field on the NW consists of young lava flows and tephra from three pyroclastic cones, including The Ash Pit, which may be the youngest volcanic feature of the Mount Edziza-Spectrum Range complex."
"Hoodoo Mountain","-131.280,56.780","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096042.jpg","","Hoodoo Mountain is a flat-topped Pleistocene-to-Holocene volcano in the Boundary Ranges of NW British Columbia near the Alaska border that is composed of both subglacial and subaerial volcanic products. Valley glaciers surround the volcano on all except the south side. The Pleistocene Little Bear Mountain basaltic tuya adjoins Hoodoo Mountain on the immediate north. Most of the volcano formed beneath glacial ice; all flank flows appear to have originated from beneath the current 4-km-wide summit icecap. More than 90% of the volcano, which dates back to at least 100,000 years, consists of interlayered peralkaline phonolitic and trachytic lava flows and hyaloclastites. At least one subaerial explosive eruption produced a welded and unwelded ignimbrite sequence on the north side. The most recent stage of volcanic activity produced subaerial unglaciated lava flows with well-preserved lava channels that originated from summit and flank vents about 9000 years ago."
"Iskut-Unuk River Cones","-130.550,56.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096044.jpg","","Eight small basaltic centers at the southern end of the Stikine volcanic belt near the Alaska border comprise the Iskut-Unuk River Cone Group, one of the youngest volcanic centers in Canada. Lava flows date back 70,000 years, but the subaerial vents produced cinder cones and lava flows that were probably all active between about 9000 and a few hundred years ago. Five of the centers produced lava flows that traveled up to about 20 km down the Iskut and Unuk River valleys and their tributaries. The three remaining centers are products of ice-contact volcanism that formed pillow lava, hyaloclastite breccias, and scoria. The Iskut-Unuk flows are similar in mineralogy and contain abundant crustal xenoliths. Vents in the Iskut River Canyon area produced at least 10 lava flows and the Lava Fork vents at least three, the latest of which erupted within the past few hundred years."
"Tseax River Cone","-128.900,55.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101045.jpg","","The basaltic Tseax River cinder cones (Aiyansh volcano) at the southern end of the Stikine volcanic belt have been the site of some of the youngest volcanic eruptions in Canada. Nested cinder cones lying along a tributary of the Nass River were the source of a lava flow that traveled into the Tseax River, damming it and forming Lava Lake. The flow subsequently traveled 11 km north to the Nass River, where it filled the flat valley floor for an additional 10 km. Native legends of the Nisga'a People tell of a prolonged period of disruption by the volcano, including the destruction of their village on the Nass River and the death of some people from 'poison smoke.' The vent was active at least twice (625 and 220 radiocarbon years ago) and other remnants of lava flows exist in the area, which was designated the Nisga'a Memorial Lava Beds Provincial Park in 1993 (Hickson and Edwards, 2001)."

Kitasu Hill on the western side of Swindle Island is a young basaltic cone that produced lava flows that extend to the north. Other postglacial vents identified by Dolmage (1921, 1924) are correlated by lithology only and may be as old as Tertiary (Baer, 1973; Holland, 1976). Basaltic tuff breccias on Lake Island and Lady Douglas Island originated from Helmet Peak on Lady Island. Basaltic lava flows from Price and Dufferin Islands overlie adjacent beach deposits (Souther; in Wood and Kienle, 1990)."
"Satah Mountain","-124.700,52.470","Satah Mountain on the Chilocotin-Nechako Plateau in central British Columbia and areas to the south form a N-S-trending chain of pyroclastic cones of Pleistocene and Holocene age (Hickson 1990, pers. comm.). Satah Mountain occupies the high point of a long ridge of trachytic lava domes and flows and basaltic and trachybasaltic pyroclastic cones extending south from the felsic Itcha Range volcanic complex. The youngest cone is well preserved and could be of comparable age to the 7200-year-old Nazko cone east of the Itcha Range (Charland et al., 1993). Most late-stage lavas capping the Itcha volcanic complex were erupted from cinder cones, tuff rings, and fissures in the eastern half of the complex."

It was formed in three episodes of activity, the first of which took place during a Pleistocene interglacial stage about 0.34 million years ago (Souther et al., 1987). The second stage produced a large hyaloclastite scoria mound erupted beneath the Cordilleran ice sheet during the late Pleistocene. The final activity occurred about 7200 years ago, forming a compound subaerial basanitic cinder cone that overtopped the hyaloclastite mound and produced two small lava flows that traveled about 1 km to the west. An airfall tephra blanket extends several km to the north and east of the cone."

Pleistocene deposits include plateau-capping lava flows, subglacial mounds and tuyas, and hyaloclastites. Buck Hill Cone was erupted during the latest Pleistocene during the waning stages of the Fraser glaciation. Holocene eruptions took place in the Spanish Creek, Ray Lake and Kostal Lake areas (Hickson and Souther, 1984), forming cinder cones and producing lava flows that traveled up to 14 km. A lava flow from Dragon cone is radiocarbon dated at about 7600 years ago, and flows from Flourmill, Kostal, and Spanish Lake Cones rest on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, suggesting an early Holocene age. The latest eruption took place from Kostal cone about 400 years ago (Hickson and Edwards, 2001)."
"Silverthrone","-126.300,51.430","The Silverthrone volcanic complex lies near the coast in SW British Columbia NW of the head of Knight Inlet. Silverthrone is a roughly circular, 20-km-wide, deeply dissected caldera complex containing rhyolitic, dacitic and andesitic lava domes, flows and breccia. The bulk of the complex appears to have been erupted between 0.1 and 0.5 million years ago (Ma), but postglacial andesitic and basaltic-andesite cones and lava flows are also present. Anomalously old Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) dates of 1.0 and 1.1 Ma were obtained from a lava flow in the postglacial Pashleth and Machmel Creek valleys (Green et al., 1988). This flow is clearly much younger than the K-Ar date, and high-energy glacial streams have only begun to etch a channel along the margin of the flow. A radiocarbon date from barnacles 8.5 km upstream from the mouth of Machmel River and buried by the flow yielded an age of 12,200 +/- 140 years (Blake, 1985). This is a maximum age for the flow, which could be much younger (Hickson and Edwards, 2001)."
"Bridge River Cones","-123.400,50.800","The Bridge River Cones volcanic field consists of a group of small basaltic and trachybasaltic eruptive centers at the extreme northern end of the Garibaldi volcanic belt in SW British Columbia. Pleistocene volcanic necks and cones were Potassium-Argon dated at 0.97 and 0.59 million years ago in the Salal Creek area and display ice-contact features (Lawrence et al., 1984). Tuber Hill is a small subaerial 600,000-year-old basaltic stratovolcano to the north that was constructed on the Bridge River upland when neighboring valleys were filled with ice. Lava flows that overlie poorly consolidated glacial till and appear to post-date the latest glaciation are found immediately north of Bridge River.

Mount Meager lies in the Garibaldi volcanic belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade volcanic arc that extends down to northern California. The summit of the complex consists of overlapping piles of andesitic lava flows and younger dacitic lava domes and flows. Quaternary basalts underlying the uppermost 22 km of the Elaho valley originated at the 1375 m level in the South Fork Meager River. The most recent activity from the Meager volcanic complex about 2350 years ago produced Canada's largest known Holocene explosive eruption and an associated welded block-and-ash flow and a lava flow from a vent on the NE flank of Plinth Peak. Two clusters of hot springs occur within the complex, which has been investigated for potential geothermal power."

The oldest stratovolcano, The Black Tusk, formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago (Ma). Following glacial dissection, renewed volcanism (0.21-0.17 Ma) produced the lava dome and flow forming its summit. Other Pleistocene vents are located along and to the west of the Cheakamus River. The Cinder Cone, to the east of The Black Tusk, produced a 9-km-long lava flow during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene (0.04 +/- 0.04 Ma). Mount Price, west of Garibaldi Lake, was formed in three stages dating back to 1.1 million years, the latest of which produced two large lava flows from Clinker Peak during the early Holocene that ponded against the retreating continental ice sheet and formed the barrier containing Garibaldi Lake. The Table, a steep-sided subglacial tuya south of Garibaldi Lake, was also formed during the early Holocene."

An initial period of volcanism 0.51-0.22 million years ago was followed after a period of quiescence by construction of a conical plug dome and breccia pile at the south summit, Atwell Peak. Retreat of the ice cap left the west flank unsupported, and it collapsed in a series of landslides, exposing the core of the volcano. Lava flows from Dalton Dome north of Atwell Peak subsequently flowed down the scarp. Subglacial flank centers such as Eanastick (Enostuck) Meadow, Glacier Pike and Paul Ridge were also formed during the late Pleistocene. The final activity of Mount Garibaldi formed the Opal Cone on the SE flank and the lengthy Ring Creek lava flow, which filled a glaciated valley on the south flank during the early Holocene (Mathews, 1958; Brooks and Friele, 1992)."

Mount Cayley itself was formed during at least three periods of activity primarily during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, but activity at satellitic dominantly subglacial vents along a N-S line north and south of Mount Cayley continued in the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Vents in the Cheakamus Valley formed a 22-km-long lava flow sequence prior to 50,000 years before present that was topped by esker-like flows of late Pleistocene age. The youngest lava flows from Pali Dome West and from the subglacial Slag Hill volcano north of Mount Cayley were not impounded by ice at low elevations, implying that they erupted after the end of the Fraser Glaciation (less than 10,000 years ago). Large volcanic landslides have occurred at heavily eroded Mount Cayley during the Holocene. At least five hot springs are present in valleys adjacent to the volcano, and shallow earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of Mount Cayley."

With the exception of the Schreibers Meadow cinder cone on the SE flank, which formed about 9800 years ago, Holocene volcanism has been confined to the central conduit. A major magmatic eruption at Mount Baker about 6500 years ago was the largest eruptive event at the volcano during the Holocene and was accompanied by a major collapse event that produced a lahars down the Nooksack drainage. Early settlers in the Puget Sound region as far away as Victoria, British Columbia observed 19th-century activity, all of which consisted of relatively minor phreatic eruptions.

More than a dozen glaciers descend its flanks, prompting its name. Although its summit towers 3000 m above surrounding valleys, the volcano was constructed above a high ridge and is itself less than 1000 m high. Repeated major explosive eruptions associated with lava dome growth during the late Pleistocene and Holocene deposited tephra over wide distances to the east. Voluminous pyroclastic flows and mudflows extended into the Puget Sound lowlands to the west and diverted several river courses into adjacent valleys.

Rainier has produced eruptions throughout the Holocene, including about a dozen during the past 2600 years; the largest of these occurred about 2200 years ago. The present-day summit cone is capped by two overlapping craters. Extensive hydrothermal alteration of the upper portion of the volcano has contributed to its structural weakness; an active thermal system has caused periodic melting on flank glaciers and produced an elaborate system of steam caves in the summit icecap.

Dacitic lava domes were emplaced during the 2nd cycle beginning about 70,000 years ago that produced ash flows that traveled 15 km to the east and west. Several Holocene cinder cones near the Cascade crest south of Jefferson have produced lava flows that traveled down glacially carved valleys, including those from Forked Butte and North Cinder Peak. The most recent eruption, from a cinder cone on the flank of the South Cinder Peak cone, produced a lava flow that traveled west into Marion Lake about 1000 years ago."
"Blue Lake Crater","-121.774,44.411","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/081080.jpg","","Blue Lake crater, one of the least known Holocene volcanoes of the Oregon Cascades, is a series of at least three overlapping explosion craters along a NE trend slightly east of the crest of the Cascade Range. Explosions through pre-existing bedrock about 1300 years ago deposited basaltic bombs and cinders and spread a tephra blanket to the east and SE during perhaps the youngest eruption in the Santiam and McKenzie Passes region. The eruption created an elongated, steep-walled crater with a low rim that rises about 50 m above adjacent topography. The crater is now filled by the 0.3 x 0.8 km wide Blue Lake, immediately west of the popular recreation area of glacial moraine dammed Suttle Lake. A chain of spatter cones 6 km to the SSW and about 4 km NE of Mount Washington, is aligned with Blue Lake crater and has ejecta that are petrographically similar to that from Blue Lake and may have been erupted at the same time."

All Three Sisters stratovolcanoes ceased activity during the late Pleistocene, but basaltic-to-rhyolitic flank vents erupted during the Holocene, producing both blocky lava flows north of North Sister and rhyolitic lava domes and flows south of South Sister volcano. Glaciers have deeply eroded the Pleistocene andesitic-dacitic North Sister stratovolcano, exposing the volcano's central plug. Construction of the main edifice ceased at about 55,000 yrs ago, but north-flank vents produced blocky lava flows in the McKenzie Pass area as recently as about 1600 years ago. Middle Sister volcano is located only 2 km to the SW and was active largely contemporaneously with South Sister until about 14,000 years ago. South Sister is the highest of the Three Sisters. It was constructed beginning about 50,000 years ago and was capped by a symmetrical summit cinder cone formed about 22,000 years ago. The late Pleistocene or early Holocene Cayuse Crater on the SW flank of Broken Top volcano and other flank vents such as Le Conte Crater on the SW flank of South Sister mark mafic vents that have erupted at considerable distances from South Sister itself, and a chain of dike-fed rhyolitic lava domes and flows at Rock Mesa and Devils Chain south of South Sister erupted about 2000 years ago."

The low-angle basaltic to basaltic-andesite shield volcano is dotted with more than 400 cinder cones; however Newberry has also produced major silicic eruptions associated with formation of a 6 x 8 km wide summit caldera containing two caldera lakes. The earliest eruptive products (<0.73 million years ago) (Ma) consist of a sequence of ash-flow and airfall tuffs. Caldera collapse is thought to be associated with major ash flows emplaced about 0.5 and 0.3-0.5 Ma. these eruptions were preceded by the emplacement of numerous mafic cones and vents and silicic lava domes and flows, many of which are aligned NNW and NNE parallel to regional fault zones. A rhyolitic magma chamber has been present throughout the Holocene. Six major eruptive episodes from the early Holocene to about 1300 years ago have included both the eruption of basaltic lava flows from flank vents and the explosive ejection of rhyolitic pumice and pyroclastic flows and the extrusion of obsidian flows within the caldera."

Inflated pahoehoe flows were erupted from spatter ramparts and spatter cones onto a nearly flat-lying surface surrounding several large kipukas of older rocks. The extremely fluid and inflated lavas left flows that typically increased from about a half meter thickness near the vent to about 5 m in more distal areas and have a volume of 1.2 cu km. The flows are older than the Mazama Ash (6800 years old) but are fresh-looking and relatively unvegetated. The precise age of Devils Garden is not known, but was considered to be either Holocene (Smith et al. 1978; Sarna-Wojciki et al. 1983) or about 20,000 years old (Chitwood 1994)."

The cone-building stage, during which at least five andesitic and dacitic shields and stratovolcanoes were constructed, took place between about 420 and 40 thousand years ago (ka). A series of rhyodacitic lava domes and flows and associated pyroclastic rocks were erupted between about 30 ka and the climactic eruption. The explosive eruptions triggering collapse of the 8-10 km wide caldera about 7500 years ago were among Earth's largest known Holocene eruptions, distributing tephra as far away as Canada and producing pyroclastic flows that traveled 40 km from the volcano. A 5-km-wide ring fracture zone is thought to mark the original collapse diameter. The deep blue waters of North America's second deepest lake, at 600 m, fill the caldera to within 150-600 m of its rim. Post-caldera eruptions within a few hundred years of caldera formation constructed a series of small lava domes on the caldera floor, including the partially subaerial Wizard Island cinder cone, and the completely submerged Merriam Cone. The latest eruptions produced a small rhyodacitic lava dome beneath the lake surface east of Wizard Island about 4200 years ago."

Older, sediment-buried Pleistocene rhyolitic lava domes have been found in geothermal drill holes. The Salton Sea geothermal field produces saline geothermal brines."
"Long Valley","-118.870,37.700","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/032096.jpg","","The large 17 x 32 km Long Valley caldera east of the central Sierra Nevada Range formed as a result of the voluminous Bishop Tuff eruption about 760,000 years ago. Resurgent doming in the central part of the caldera occurred shortly afterwards, followed by rhyolitic eruptions from the caldera moat and the eruption of rhyodacite from outer ring fracture vents, ending about 50,000 years ago. During early resurgent doming the caldera was filled with a large lake that left strandlines on the caldera walls and the resurgent dome island; the lake eventually drained through the Owens River Gorge. The caldera remains thermally active, with many hot springs and fumaroles, and has had significant deformation, seismicity, and other unrest in recent years. The late-Pleistocene to Holocene Inyo Craters cut the NW topographic rim of the caldera, and along with Mammoth Mountain on the SW topographic rim, are west of the structural caldera and are chemically and tectonically distinct from the Long Valley magmatic system."
"Black Butte Crater Lava Field","-114.352,43.183","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/102092.jpg","","The Black Butte Crater lava field (formerly Shoshone lava field) is the westernmost of the young lava fields of the Eastern Snake River Plain. It lies north of Twin Falls, Idaho and created an L-shaped lava flow 2-to-5 km in width that extends 60 km south and then west. A single radiocarbon age of 10,130 +/- 350 years was obtained for lava flows from the field (Kuntz et al. 1986). Black Butte Crater caps a lava shield that lies at the NE end of the flow field. The vent area contains a complex lava lake that forms a six-part flower-petal like depression with steep-sided walls up to 30 m high that covers an area of 2 sq km. A lava tube and channel system extends 5 km SE of the crater and displays both roofed and collapsed portions. The Big Wood and Little Wood rivers follow the northern and southern margins of the distal part of the lava flow, respectively. The voluminous flow diverted the river channels so that they now join 40 km west of their former confluence."
"Craters of the Moon","-113.500,43.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/033019.jpg","","Craters of the Moon, the largest lava field of the Snake River Plain (SRP), covers about 1600 sq km with more than 60 mappable lava flows erupted from eight fissure systems. About 25 cinder cones up to 250-m high formed primarily along a 45-km-long segment of the Great Rift, the principal 2-8 km wide fissure system that trends NW-SE through Craters of the Moon National Monument. Craters of the Moon lies at the NW part of the Eastern Snake River Plain, and the northern part of the field laps up against the White Knob and Pioneer Mountains. The lava field was formed during eight eruptive episodes between about 15,000 and 2000 years ago separated by quiescent periods up to about 3000 years in duration. This contrasts with other SRP lava fields, which were formed during single eruptive episodes of relatively short duration. A complex assemblage of basaltic volcanic features is found at Craters of the Moon, and cinder cones are common."
"Wapi Lava Field","-113.220,42.880","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/102068.jpg","","The Wapi lava field, SE of the Craters of the Moon, covers about 325 sq km, and consists of a low shield volcano formed during an eruption about 2250 years ago that produced about 6 cu km of fluid pahoehoe lava flows. The small King's Bowl rift immediately to the north was also formed at about the same time along a central eruptive fissure flanked by two parallel non-eruptive fissures. This eruption produced a phreatic explosion that created Kings Bowl, an 80-m-long, 30-m-deep explosion crater. Eruptions of the Wapi lava field also overlapped with the last eruptive period of the Craters of the Moon lava field. The vent area lies along the Great Rift of the Craters of the Moon and consists of five major and a half dozen minor vents covering an area of 0.5 sq km. The largest of the vents contains several pit craters that truncate lava lakes that filled the crater. Pillar Butte, a mass of layered lava flows and agglutinates, forms the high point of the lava shield. The Split Butte maar to the west is partially overlapped by flows of the Wapi lava field."
"Hell's Half Acre","-112.450,43.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/102083.jpg","","Hell's Half Acre lava field, the easternmost of the young basaltic lava fields of the Snake River Plain, covers an area of about 400 sq km SW of Idaho Falls and is the 2nd largest of the Snake River Plain. Basaltic lavas forming the broad, low shield volcano are dominantly pahoehoe flows that were erupted from a 3-km-long, NW-SE trending vent system at the NW part of the field during a brief eruptive episode about 5200 years ago. The summit vent area contains an irregular, elongate 0.8 x 0.3 km wide central depression that was the site of a former lava lake that fed late-stage flows. About 10 circular pit craters truncate the surface of the lava lake, and two prominent lava tube systems are located near the summit vent complex. Two major lava flow lobes, each about 5 km wide and 10 km long, extend to the south and SW along the flood plain of the Snake River and surround Morgans Pasture, a large kipuka. Interstate 15 highway crosses the SE margin of the lava field SW of the city of Idaho Falls."

Eruption of the >2450 cu km Huckleberry Ridge Tuff about 2.1 million years ago created the more than 75-km-long Island Park caldera. The second cycle concluded with the eruption of the Mesa Falls Tuff around 1.3 million years ago, forming the 16-km-wide Henrys Fork caldera at the western end of the first caldera. Activity subsequently shifted to the present Yellowstone Plateau and culminated 640,000 years ago with the eruption of the >1000 cu km Lava Creek Tuff and the formation of the present 45 x 85 km caldera. Resurgent doming subsequently occurred at both the NE and SW sides of the caldera and voluminous (1000 cu km) intracaldera rhyolitic lava flows were erupted between 150,000 and 70,000 years ago. No magmatic eruptions have occurred since the late Pleistocene, but large hydrothermal eruptions took place near Yellowstone Lake during the Holocene. Yellowstone is presently the site of one of the world's largest hydrothermal systems including Earth's largest concentration of geysers."
"Soda Lakes","-118.870,39.530","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118007.jpg","","Two lake-filled maars, Soda Lake and Little Soda Lake, lie NW of the town of Fallon. The basaltic maars were formed subaerially, post-dating the Pleistocene glacial Lake Lahontan, and were estimated to be less than 10,000 years old and perhaps even less than 1500 years old (Garside and Schilling, 1979; Price and LaPointe, 1998). The larger maar, Soda Lake, is about 1.3 x 2 km wide and is elongated in a NE-SW direction. The 300-m-wide Little Soda Lake lies south of Soda Lake. The late-Pleistocene Upsal Hogback cones lie to the NNE of Soda Lakes. The maars are the site of a geothermal prospect that may have discharged hot springs through the end of the 19th century."

No eruptive activity has occurred at Steamboat Springs during the Holocene, although it was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Coombs and Howard 1960) based on its geothermal activity. The Steamboat Springs area is dotted with about 50 active hot springs, numerous steam vents, and fumaroles, and is an actively producing geothermal field."
"Markagunt Plateau","-112.670,37.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/055002.jpg","","A group of basaltic cinder cones and lava vents on the Markagunt Plateau east of Cedar Breaks National Monument in SW Utah has produced youthful, sparsely vegetated lava flows. Products of an older episode of volcanism producing trachytic, andesitic and rhyolitic lavas were succeeded by basaltic lavas of two different ages. Several lines of NE-SW-trending cinder cones occur within the volcanic field, with the youngest flows being located near Panguitch Lake on the north and Navajo Lake on the south. Navajo Lake formed when a thick, blocky flow from a nearby vent dammed Duck Creek. Young lava flows, many of which are fissure fed, have distinct margins and covered or diverted stream drainages, which have for the most part not been reestablished across the flows. The oldest trees on the youngest flows are about 900 years old (Gregory, 1949) and Southern Paiute legends note 'smoking hills' and red-hot lava flows in the Panguitch Lake area, although it is not known if the lava flows are that young."
"Black Rock Desert","-112.500,38.970","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/045092.jpg","","The Black Rock Desert volcanic field consists of a group of closely spaced small volcanic fields of Pleistocene-to-Holocene age in the Black Rock and Sevier deserts of south-central Utah, at the eastern margin of the Great Basin. The Black Rock Desert field contains both Utah's youngest known rhyolite dome (0.4 million years old) and its youngest eruptive vent, which produced the roughly 660-year-old Ice Springs lava flows. The broader Black Rock Desert volcanic field includes the smaller Deseret, Pavant, Kanosh, Tabernacle, Ice Spring, and northern Black Rock Desert volcanic fields. The Pavant Butte and Tabernacle Hill tuff cones were erupted about 16,000 and 14,000 years ago through the waters of glacial Lake Bonneville. Lava flows from the Ice Springs crater complex traveled about 4 km to the west and north, overlapping late-Pleistocene flows from Pavant Butte."
"Dotsero","-107.035,39.661","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/081066.jpg","","A small maar and scoria cone complex at Dotsero, near the junction of the Colorado and Eagle Rivers west of the Gore Range, is the only Holocene volcano in Colorado. Although Interstate highway 70 cuts across a lava flow from Dotsero, this volcanic center is one of the least known in the western United States. The most prominent feature of the Dotsero complex is a 700 m wide and 400 m deep maar that was erupted about 4150 radiocarbon years ago along a ridge consisting of evaporites and reddish oxidized sandstones of Pennsylvanian age. Small scoria cones were constructed along a NNE-SSW line on either side of the maar. Small lahars preceded eruption of a basaltic lava flow that traveled 3 km down two narrow V-shaped valleys and spread out onto the floodplain of the Eagle River, diverting the river to the south side of the valley. Older Pleistocene basaltic lava flows occur nearby at Willow Peak, McCoy, and Triangle Peak."
"Uinkaret Field","-113.130,36.380","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/087073.jpg","","The Uinkaret volcanic field straddling the Grand Canyon contains cinder cones that have produced lava flows that repeatedly cascaded into the Grand Canyon, forming temporary lava dams up to 200 m high. Two of the most prominent landmarks are Vulcan's Throne, a cinder cone on the north rim, and Vulcan's Forge, a small volcanic neck erupted within the Colorado River, 1000 m below. Most of the field lies north of the Grand Canyon on the Uinkaret Plateau between the Toroweap and Hurricane faults. It is largely Pleistocene in age, and Vulcan's Throne has a cosmogenic helium age of about 73,000 years. Volcanic activity has continued into the Holocene. One lava flow, from Little Springs, south of Pliocene Mount Trumbull, has a cosmogenic helium age of 1300 +/- 500 years BP. Pottery sherds dated at between 1050 and 1200 CE were found within the Little Springs lava flow, which occurred about the same time as the Sunset Crater eruption in the San Francisco volcanic field to the SE."

The eruptions forming the 340-m-high Sunset Crater cinder cone were initially considered from tree-ring dating to have begun between the growing seasons of 1064-1065 CE; however, more recent paleomagnetic evidence places the activity between about 1080 and 1150 CE. The largest vent, Sunset Crater itself, was the source of the Bonito and Kana-a lava flows that extended about 2.5 km NW and 9.6 km NE, respectively. Additional vents along a 10-km-long fissure extending SE produced small spatter ramparts and a 6.4-km-long lava flow to the east. A blanket of ash and lapilli covered an area of more than 2100 sq km and forced the abandonment of settlements of the indigenous Sinagua Indians."
"Carrizozo","-105.930,33.780","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/081088.jpg","","The massive Carrizozo lava flow, which traveled 75 km down the Tularosa Basin of south-central New Mexico, is one of Earth's longest known Holocene lava flows. The youthful-looking basaltic flow originated from a broad low basaltic shield on the floor of the Tularosa Basin, east of the Rio Grande Rift, topped by Little Black Peak, a small cinder cone. The 4.2 cu km tube-fed pahoehoe flow covered 330 sq km and has a width that ranges from 1 km in the central neck region to 5 km in the proximal and distal portions. The flow was inferred to have been emplaced during a single long-duration eruption estimated to have lasted 2-3 decades. A surface exposure age of about 5200 years Before Present was obtained for the Carrizozo lava flow, the second youngest in New Mexico. An older lava flow traveled 16 km south and 11 km east from Broken Back crater."
"Zuni-Bandera","-108.000,34.800","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/033087.jpg","","The Zuni-Bandera volcanic field covers an area of 2460 sq km along the Jemez lineament west of the Rio Grande Rift. An older volcanic episode, mostly from vents along the Chain of Craters, took place from about 3.8-3.7 million years ago (Ma); the younger episode began about 1.7 Ma and has continued until the present, forming an extensive area of young lava flows known as El Malpais. The youngest lava flow, the McCartys flow, traveled 60 km to the NE, fed by lava tubes up to 29 km long. The McCartys flow was recorded in Indian legends and was thought to have been erupted about 1000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating indicates an age of about 3000 years Before Present. The only other dated flow of Holocene age originated from Bandera Crater during the early Holocene about 9000-10,000 radiocarbon years ago. An earlier flow, the massive Pleistocene Fence Lake lava flow, traveled as far as 90 km to the west."
"Valles Caldera","-106.570,35.870","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/033094.jpg","","The 22-km-wide Valles caldera was formed as a result of two large volume eruptions that created the widespread Bandelier Tuff ignimbrite plateaus on all sides of the caldera. The lower member of the Bandelier Tuff, the Otawi, was emplaced about 1.7 million years ago (Ma) and resulted in the formation of most of the present-day Valles caldera, including the Toledo embayment at the NE side. The upper member, the Tshirege, is dated about 1.2 Ma, and also deposited voluminous welded pyroclastic flows over about the same area as the Otawi member. Post-caldera volcanism has included the emplacement of multiple ring-fracture lava domes and uplift of the caldera floor, forming the Redondo Peak resurgent dome. The El Cajete Pumice, Battleship Rock Ignimbrite, Banco Bonito Rhyolite, and the VC-1 Rhyolite were emplaced during the youngest eruption of Valles caldera, about 50,000-60,000 years ago. Seismic investigations show that a low-velocity zone lies beneath the caldera, and an active geothermal system with hot springs and fumaroles exists today."
"Endeavour Segment","-129.100,47.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118084.jpg","","The Endeavour Segment (or Ridge) lies near the northern end of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, west of the coast of Washington and SW of Vancouver Island.

The 90-km-long, NNE-SSW-trending segment lies at a depth of more than 2000 m and is the site of vigorous high-temperature hydrothermal vent systems that were first discovered by scientists in 1981. Five major vent fields that include sulfide chimneys and black smoker vents, first seen from the submersible vehicle Alvin in 1984, are spaced at about 2-km intervals in a 1-km-wide axial valley at the center of the ridge. Preliminary uranium-series dates of Holocene age were obtained on basaltic lava flows, and other younger 'zero-age' flows were sampled. Seismic swarms were detected in 1991 and 2005."
"Cobb Segment","-129.330,46.880","The Cobb Segment in the northern part of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, lies south of the Endeavour Ridge segment.

It has a narrow, 1-2 km wide axial crest with a shallow graben that has a high point at a depth of about 2300 m. A prominent seamount with hydrothermal deposits at its summit lies just west of the axis high and was the source of a broad area of young, mostly sediment-free lava flows. As with other Juan de Fuca Ridge segments, a shallow magma chamber is thought to underlie the Cobb Segment, and a preliminary uranium-series date of Holocene age was obtained on a basaltic lava flow from the Cobb Segment."
"CoAxial Segment","-129.580,46.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/103041.jpg","","The CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge is located about 435 km west of the Oregon coast, NE of Axial volcano. A submarine eruption along the CoAxial segment that produced thermal plumes and a new lava flow was detected by acoustic hydrophones in June 1993, just days after installation of the hydrophone system. This marked the first deep-sea volcanic eruption that was detected as it was happening. The location of the eruption was at a depth of about 2400 m, about 37 km NE of Axial volcano. Bathymetric surveys indicated that one or more additional sea-floor lava extrusions took place immediately to the east of the 1993 lava flow sometime between 1981-82 and 1991."
"Axial Seamount","-130.000,45.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118087.jpg","","Axial Seamount rises 700 m above the mean level of the central Juan de Fuca Ridge crest about 480 km W of Cannon Beach, Oregon, to within about 1400 m of the sea surface. It is the most magmatically robust and seismically active site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge between the Blanco Fracture Zone and the Cobb offset. The summit is marked by an unusual rectangular-shaped caldera (3 x 8 km) that lies between two rift zones and is estimated to have formed about 31,000 years ago. The caldera is breached to the SE and is defined on three sides by boundary faults of up to 150 m relief. Hydrothermal vents with biological communities are located near the caldera fault and along the rift zones. Hydrothermal venting was discovered north of the caldera in 1983. Detailed mapping and sampling efforts have identified more than 50 lava flows emplaced since about 410 CE (Clague et al., 2013). Eruptions producing fissure-fed lava flows that buried previously installed seafloor instrumentation were detected seismically and geodetically in 1998 and 2011, and confirmed shortly after each eruption during submersible dives."

The 80-km-long segment is named for a nearly continuous 10-km-long, 30-50 m wide cleft at its southern end. Two episodes of sea-floor spreading have been documented along the northern part of the Cleft Segment in the 1980's. Bathymetric surveys indicated that a series of discontinuous pillow-lava mounds were extruded along a 17-km-long fissure between 1981 and 1987. The eruption possibly took place at the time of emission of a large plume of hot mineral-laden water in 1986. The location is at a depth of about 2300 m near the northern edge of the Cleft segment and the southern end of the Vance segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, about 500 km west of the central Oregon coast.

The 65-km-long segment is located about 200 km W of the southern Oregon coast and has deep 5- 10-km-wide valleys at either ends with a shallower narrow axial valley at the center. This morphology, which in plan view resembles an hourglass, is typical of magmatically active spreading segments. A submarine lava flow was erupted in late February and early March 1996, near the center of the segment. The eruption was initially detected through acoustic T-waves from a seismic swarm and the emission of large thermal plumes. In April submarine cameras revealed new lava flows about 100-200 m wide along a fissure that was at least 3.5 km long. A seismic swarm of uncertain origin also occurred at this location in January 1998."

The rift valley floor of the slow-spreading segment lies at about 3200 m depth, bounded by faulted walls about 1500 m high with unusual gold-bearing massive sulfide deposits in sediment hills at the base of the scarps uplifted by volcanic sills or lacoliths. Thick sediment deposits from the continental margin enter the axial trough from the fracture zone and thin to the north. A preliminary uranium-series date of Holocene age was obtained from a basaltic lava flow in the axial valley in the less-sedimented northern part."
"Jackson Segment","-127.050,42.150","The Jackson Segment of the Gorda Ridge more than 200 km off the coast of Oregon lies immediately SSW of the North Gorda Ridge, the northermost of five segments forming the Gorda Ridge spreading center. The first recorded activity took place in April 2001, when volcanic seismicity was detected by hydroacoustic monitoring. The seismicity indicated possible dike propagation to the south and was similar to that which was documented at the time of the eruption of a submarine lava flow from the adjacent North Gorda Ridge segment in 1996. The 2001 activity originated from the central axial valley of the Jackson Segment, near the 'narrowgate' on the southern part of the segment. Later surveys, however, revealed no evidence for submarine eruptive activity in April 2001."

In January 1994 a T-wave swarm suggested eruptive activity. Investigations later that year were inconclusive regarding an associated eruption, but found an active hydrothermal mound on the flanks of a pillow-lava volcano. Dziak et al.

"Loihi","-155.270,18.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/033100.jpg","","Loihi seamount, the youngest volcano of the Hawaiian chain, lies about 35 km off the SE coast of the island of Hawaii. Loihi (which is the Hawaiian word for 'long') has an elongated morphology dominated by two curving rift zones extending north and south of the summit. The summit region contains a caldera about 3 x 4 km wide and is dotted with numerous lava cones, the highest of which is about 975 m below the sea surface. The summit platform includes two well-defined pit craters, sediment-free glassy lava, and low-temperature hydrothermal venting. An arcuate chain of small cones on the western edge of the summit extends north and south of the pit craters and merges into the crests of Loihi's prominent rift zones. Deep and shallow seismicity indicate a magmatic plumbing system distinct from that of Kilauea volcano. During 1996, a new pit crater was formed at the summit of the volcano, and lava flows were erupted. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually build a new island at Loihi; time estimates for the summit to reach the sea surface range from roughly 10,000 to 100,000 years."

The 3 x 5 km caldera was formed in several stages about 1500 years ago and during the 18th century; eruptions have also originated from the lengthy East and SW rift zones, which extend to the sea on both sides of the volcano. About 90% of the surface of the basaltic shield volcano is formed of lava flows less than about 1100 years old; 70% of the volcano's surface is younger than 600 years. A long-term eruption from the East rift zone that began in 1983 has produced lava flows covering more than 100 sq km, destroying nearly 200 houses and adding new coastline to the island."

In contrast to Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea lacks a summit caldera and is capped by a profusion of cinder cones and pyroclastic deposits. It's rift zones are less pronounced than on neighboring volcanoes, and the eruption of voluminous, late-stage pyroclastic material has buried much of the early basaltic shield volcano, creating a steeper and more irregular profile. This transition took place about 200,000 to 250,000 years ago, and much of Mauna Kea, whose Hawaiian name means 'White Mountain,' was constructed during the Pleistocene. Its age and high altitude make it the only Hawaiian volcano with glacial moraines. A road that reaches a cluster of astronomical observatories on the summit also provides access to seasonal tropical skiing.

Three rift zones, dotted with cinder cones and spatter cones, trend north, NW, and SE, and converge about 5 km east of the summit. Detailed mapping has shown that 95% of the surface area of the basaltic shield volcano is of Holocene age, more than half is less than 3000 years old, and a quarter is less than 1000 years old. The only historical eruptions of Hualalai took place during the end of the 18th century and in 1801, when lava flows from vents on the NW rift zone reached the sea and buried Hawaiian villages; the 1801 Huehue lava flow underlies part of the international airport at Kona. The earlier of the two flows, the Kaupulehu lava flow, is notable for its large quantities of lava-encrusted mafic and ultramafic nodular xenoliths."
"Haleakala","-156.250,20.708","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036003.jpg","http://kopiko.ifa.hawaii.edu/cams/crater.shtml","The massive Haleakala shield volcano forms the eastern portion of the dumbbell-shaped island of Maui. The summit of 3055-m Haleakala contains a dramatic, 3.5 x 9.5 km summit crater that is widely breached on the north and SE sides. The 'crater' is not of volcanic origin, but formed as a result of the coalescence of headward erosion of the Koolau and Kaupo valleys. Subsequently the crater has been partially filled by a chain of young cinder cones and lava flows erupted along a major rift zone that extends across the basaltic shield volcano from the SW to the east flanks. Another less prominent rift zone trends north from the summit. The most recent eruption was thought to have occurred between the exploring voyages of La Perouse in 1786 and Vancouver in 1793, but uncertainty surrounds the date of this event, which could have occurred in about 1750 CE (anthropological evidence) or several centuries earlier (radiocarbon dates)."
"Teahitia","-148.821,-17.564","Teahitia is a submarine volcano in the Society Islands whose summit reaches to within ~1700 m of the surface, 40 km NE of the SE tip of Tahiti Island. Several seismic swarms in the 1980s included volcanic tremor that may have resulted from submarine eruptions (Talandier and Opal, 1984). Rocks dredged in 1986 'exploded' when they reached the surface, suggesting recent lava extrusion that had not yet had time to equilibrate with pressure and temperature conditions on the submerged flanks of the edifice. Two hydrothermal fields each about 1 km by 400 m in size that emitted low-temperature hydrothermal venting were discovered on the flanks during submersible dives in 1986 and 1989."
"Rocard","-148.586,-17.662","Rocard is a small volcanci seamount about 60 km WNW of Mehetia and 28 km ESE of Teahitia seamount. It displayed seismicity in 1966, 1971, and 1972 that may have resulted from submarine eruptions (Talandier and Custer, 1976). Rocks dredged in 1986 'exploded' when they reached the surface, suggesting recent lava extrusion that had not yet had time to equilibrate with pressure and temperature conditions on the submerged flanks of the edifice. The summit lies 2500 m below sea level."
"Moua Pihaa","-148.525,-18.325","Moua Pihaa is a massive, steep-sided submarine volcano that rises to within 160 m of the sea surface SW of Mehetia Island. It is the largest of a group of seamounts along the Society Island hot spot chain near Mehetia and Tahiti Islands and towers 3500 m above the sea floor. It displayed seismicity in 1969 and 1970 considered to have been related to submarine eruptions (Talandier and Custer, 1976)."
"Mehetia","-148.068,-17.874","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/103044.jpg","","The 1.5-km-wide, steep-sided island of Mehetia, the youngest and SE-most of the Society Islands, lacks a well-developed fringing coral reef. The ~400-m-high island (known as Meetia or Meketia in the Tahitian and Tuamotuan languages, respectively) is the summit of a large volcano that rises 4000 m from the sea floor. An older edifice is formed of a lava flow sequence overlain by hydromagmatic deposits and strombolian ejecta. A well-preserved Holocene crater, 150 m wide and 80 m deep, is located NW of the summit and has been the source of the youngest lava flows on the island (Binard et al., 1993). Polynesian legends mention 'large fires,' and the lack of vegetation on some lava flows suggests that the latest activity occurred within the last 2000 years (Talandier and Custer, 1976). Other recent activity originated from a submarine crater at 2500-2700 m depth on the SE flank."
"Adams Seamount","-129.270,-25.370","Adams Seamount was constructed above the Pitcairn hot spot in the central Pacific, about 90 km WSW of Pitcairn Island. The massive seamount rises about 3500 m to within 59 m of the sea surface about 25 km SW of another large submarine volcano within the Pitcairn hot spot, Bounty Seamount. The Pitcairn hot spot was built over 30-million-year-old Pacific Ocean crust, and in addition to the two large volcanoes, Adams and Bounty seamounts, contains about 20 small volcanic hills about 500 m high. Although Bounty Seamount, which rises to within 450 m of the sea surface, appears morphologically more youthful than Adams and water samples indicate continuing hydrothermal activity, two late-Pleistocene Potassium-Argon dates of about 338,000 and 350,000 years were obtained from the flanks of Bounty. Alkali basaltic rocks were dredged from the flanks of Adams Seamount, whose summit appears to consist of a trachytic lava dome. Several Potassium-Argon dates of Holocene age were obtained from dredges at Adams Seamount (Guillou et al., 1997), the youngest of which was 2000 +/- 1000 years."
"Macdonald","-140.250,-28.980","Discovered by the detection of teleseismic waves in 1967, Macdonald seamount (also known as Tamarii seamount) rises from a depth of about 1800 m to within 27 m of the sea surface at the eastern end of the Austral Islands. The alkali-basaltic submarine volcano marks the site of a hotspot that was the source of the Austral-Cook island chain. The summit of the seamount, named after volcanologist Gordon Macdonald, consists of a flat plateau about 100 x 150 m wide with an average depth of about 40 m. The summit plateau is capped with spatter cones that form steep-sided pinnacles. Most eruptions have been seismically detected, but in 1987 and 1989 pumice emission was observed from research vessels. Pumice rafts observed in the South Pacific in 1928 and 1936 may also have originated here."
"Northern EPR-Segment RO2","-105.320,16.550","Segment RO2 of the Northern East Pacific Rise lies between the Orozco and Rivera transform faults, immediately south of the Rivera transform. The segment displays a typical small rifted axial crest, about 2-3 km wide and about 20-50 m deep. At some locations the summit trough almost disappears, suggesting high rates of volcanism. A seamount lies just east of the axial crest at about 16 deg 33 min N. Magnetic paleointensity measurements on basaltic glasses dated a lava flow at about 2000 +/- 1000 years and another at 'contemporary' age, perhaps decades to a few hundred years old."
"Northern EPR-Segment RO3","-105.430,15.830","Segment RO3 of the Northern East Pacific Rise lies between the Orozco and Rivera transform faults, immediately north of the Orozco transform. Unlike segment RO2 to the north, the RO3 segment displays a broad, shallow profile that is the widest and shallowest of a 5000-km-long segment of the East Pacific Rise between 23 degrees south to 23 degrees north. The flat axial crest ranges from 3-4 to about 10 km wide and is about 2300-2350 m deep; the axis morphology suggests a high magma supply rate. Magnetic paleointensity measurements on basaltic glasses dated several lava flows along segment RO3 at about 2000 +/- 1000 years, suggesting a major volcanic episode that produced lava flows flooding much of the axial plateau and extended on to its flanks. Several other lava flows were dated at 'contemporary' ages, perhaps less than 100 years."
"Unnamed","-103.580,10.730","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119070.jpg","","Divers in the submersible Alvin discovered an extremely fresh lava flow in an unexpected location at 10 degrees 44 minutes North on the East Pacific Rise during an expedition in November 2003. The young flow was covered by bacterial mats, had large amounts of bacterial floc ('snow-blowers') issuing from diffuse vents, and was sparsely populated by small animals. Uranium-series dating indicated that the eruption had taken place within a time window only a few months to weeks prior to the observations. This segment of the East Pacific Rise, located just north of the Clipperton Transform Fault, is an area with an estimated low magma production rate."
"Unnamed","-104.300,9.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118078.jpg","","Evidence for a very recent, possibly ongoing eruption was detected during a series of dives in the submersible vessel Alvin in 1991 on the East Pacific Rise at about 9 deg 50 min N. Hot-vent animal communities that had been documented during November to December 1989 imaging were observed to have been buried by fresh basaltic lava flows, and the scorched soft tissues of partially buried biota had not yet attracted bottom scavengers. Fresh black smoker chimneys were draped by new lava flows. This position was at a depth of about 2500 m south of the Clipperton fracture zone, about 1000 km SW of Acapulco, México. It coincided with a location where fresh lava flows previously estimated as less than roughly 50 years in age had been found. Later dating of very short half-life radionuclides from dredged samples confirmed the young age of the eruption and indicated that another eruptive event had taken place in late 1991 and early 1992. An eruption in 2005-2006 produced lava flows that entrapped previously emplaced seismometers."
"Galapagos Rift","-86.150,0.792","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118083.jpg","","The E-W-trending Galápagos Rift, an oceanic spreading ridge between the Cocos plate to the north and the Nazca plate to the south, is located north of the Galápagos Islands. A large area of hydrothermal vents along the crest of the ridge ENE of the Galápagos Islands was discovered in 1977. The location listed here is the position of Clambake vent, which was surrounded by very youthful sediment-free flows of basaltic sheet lava. This position is at the northern limit of the location error circle for a 1972 earthquake swarm and only a few km south of a concurrent fish kill (Macdonald & Mudie, 1974) that may have been associated with extrusion of these young flows. Morphology of the flows suggested that they were less than 5 years old (Chadwick and Embley, 1994). The Galápagos Rift at this point consists of a small rift valley 3-4 km wide with walls 200-250 m high. A low axial ridge formed by the youngest sediment-free lava flows rises about 20 m above the valley floor, flanked by older marginal ridges. A 2002 expedition discovered evidence for new lava flows covering markers emplaced in 1990."
"Unnamed","-107.950,-8.270","A massive 15 +/- 4 cu km lava flow field covers about 220 sq km of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis crest at about 8 degrees South. The high reflectivity of the lava flow indicates a very youthful age. This, coupled with teleseismically recorded earthquakes in 1964, 1965, and 1969 of an unusual magnitude along this segment of the EPR and the detection of a helium megaplume of a volume consistent with the eruption of a lava flow of this volume detected several years later at a distant location consistent with inferred circulation patterns at mid-ocean depths led Macdonald et al. (1989) to suggest that part or all of this lava field may have been emplaced in the past 25 years, during one or more eruptions coincident with the earthquakes and onset of the helium plume."
"Southern EPR-Segment K","-113.206,-17.436","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118082.jpg","","Lava flows from a very recent volcanic eruption were observed in 1994 along segment K of the southern East Pacific Rise. This segment of the mid-ocean ridge north of the Easter microplate displays the broadest cross-sectional area and the shallowest depth (2566 m) of the southern East Pacific Rise between 13 degrees 40 minutes and 18 degrees 30 minutes south. Glassy, unsedimented lava flows on the 17.5 degrees S segment of the East Pacific Rise were considered from biological observations and chemical analyses of the plume and vent fluids to have been erupted within 2-3 years of a November-December 1993 plume survey. Lava was erupted along two segments of the mid-ocean ridge, a 4-km-long flow at the southern site and a 5-10 km long flow at the northern site. Numerous low- and high-temperature hydrothermal vents are active along this segment of the mid-ocean ridge."

Horst and graben structures expose cooled lava lakes and both active and extinct hydrothermal chimneys. Basaltic lava flow fields, lava pillars, and pillow mounds are found on the floor of the graben. The largest lava flow field is the Moai lava flow at about 18 deg 12 min S.

An axial dome is located along the southern part of the segment. The largest lava flow field in this segment is the Animal Farm flow, named after a thriving low-temperature hydrothermal site discovered during a submersible expedition in 1993. The Animal Farm lava flow was dated by magnetic paleointensity measurements at about 1880-1950 CE, and older flows were dated by similar techniques to the 17th and 19th centuries."
"Hollister Ridge","-139.845,-53.998","Acoustic T-waves from a seismic swarm, possibly associated with magmatic activity, were recorded in 1991 from a location 130 km south of the Eltanin Fracture Zone (Global Volcanism Network Bulletin, 1991).

Cerro Prieto lies in an active continental rift that is transitional between the transform San Andreas fault system to the north and a spreading ridge of the East Pacific Rise in the Gulf of California to the south. The only surficial volcanic feature at Cerro Prieto, which is located near sea level on the Colorado River delta, is a small, 223-m-high compound dacitic lava dome. A 200-m-wide crater is located at the summit of the NE-most dome. The Cerro Prieto dome was roughly estimated from paleomagnetic evidence to have formed during a series of events between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. Cucupas Indian legends described a monster that covered the land with hot rocks, which grew through the soil and emitted fire tongues, a possible reference to the growth of the volcano."
"Pinacate","-113.498,31.772","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036006.jpg","","Pinacate is a large, roughly 55 x 60 km volcanic field in the Sonoran desert of NW México. It contains numerous youthful maars, tuff rings, and cinder cones of late-Pleistocene to Holocene age. The 2000 sq km volcanic field is prominent in satellite images of this arid, sparsely populated region between the Arizona border and the head of the Gulf of California. An older volcanic episode constructed the 1200-m-high Santa Clara basaltic-to-trachytic shield volcano. This was followed by the eruption of more than 500 basaltic cinder cones and lava flows that blanket the slopes of Santa Clara and the surrounding desert. Among the principal features of the Pinacate volcanic field are Elegante crater, a 1.6-km-wide maar, and Cerro Colorado, a 110-m-high, 1.1-km-wide tuff ring. Papago (Tohono O'odham) Indian legends tell of eruptions, however historical accounts of ash-and-steam eruptions in the 20th century are questionable."
"San Quintin Volcanic Field","-115.996,30.468","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036022.jpg","","San Quintín volcanic field on the NW coast of Baja California consists of 11 late-Pleistocene to Holocene volcanic complexes. Low lava shields, initially submarine, are capped by well-preserved scoria cones. San Quintín rocks are similar to intraplate or oceanic island alkalic rocks and differ from other Baja alkalic volcanic suites. San Quintín is the only Quaternary volcanic field in Baja California where lower-crustal and upper-mantle xenoliths are found. The field is located at the margins of the Y-shaped San Quintín Bay and includes a northern and southern group of cones, Monte Mazo (connected to the mainland by a long tombolo), and Isla San Martín, 5 km offshore to the west. The youngest craters overlie deposits thought to be dated at 5-6000 years before present, and Gastil et al. (1975) considered the southern cones of Vizcaino and Sudoeste to possibly be less than 3000 years old. However, later Argon/Argon dating (Ortega-Rivera et al., 2004) restricted eruptions to a range of between about 20,000 to 180,000 years ago."

The roughly 180-m-high island (also known as La Encantada Mayor, or Salvatierra) is located 3 km off the eastern shore of Baja California north of Punta Bufeo. The small 4.5 sq km island has an irregular shoreline with a narrow peninsula forming its SW tip. Initial basaltic-andesite and andesitic submarine surtseyan eruptions producing palagonite tuffs were followed by the effusion of subaerial dacitic lava flows and the formation of dacitic tuff rings. The latest eruptions formed two rhyolitic obsidian domes, the younger in a tuff cone at the center of the island and at the older at the NW tip of the island. Although the age of the domes is not known precisely, Medina et al. (1989) suggested that they could be less than a century old."

Located primarily on the Pacific Ocean side of northern Baja between Jaraguay and Arroyo San José, the Jaraguay field contains numerous youthful-looking cinder cones and associated basaltic and basaltic-andesite lava flows. Some lava flows are less vegetated than flows of the San Quintín volcanic field to the north that overlie 5000-6000 year-old midden deposits (Rogers et al., 1985).

The age of the most recent eruptive activity from Volcán Coronado is not known, although fumarolic activity was reported in September 1539 (Medina et al., 1989)."
"Guadalupe","-118.280,29.070","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/093074.jpg","","Elongated Guadalupe Island lies atop a fossil oceanic ridge crest about 300 km west of Baja California. The seamount, which rises above the Pacific Ocean surface to an elevation of 1100 m, contains two shield volcanoes, the northern of which is the youngest. Chains of cinder cones constructed along fissures oriented both NW-SE and NE-SW and associated lava flows overlie both shield volcanoes. The longest of these fissures cuts across the caldera of the northern volcano and extends beyond it to the SE. Other pyroclastic cones were constructed along an arcuate fissure near the southern caldera rim. The shield volcanoes and products of the fissure eruptions form a complete alkali basaltic-to-trachytic series reflecting a transition from submarine to subaerial volcanism. The 1100-m-high northern basaltic shield volcano was considered to be of Holocene age (Medina et al. 1989). Trachytic lava domes are found within the caldera of the northern shield volcano, and together with very fresh-looking alkali basalt lava flows, form the youngest volcanic rocks on the island."
"San Borja Volcanic Field","-113.750,28.500","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/075062.jpg","","The San Borja volcanic field, also known as the El Rosarito volcanic field, is located in central Baja California NE of the Vizcaino Peninsula. Holocene lava flows occur at Rosarito and Morro San Domingo at the western end of the San Borja volcanic field along the coast north of the Vizcaino Peninsula. Some lava flows of the San Borja volcanic field are less vegetated than flows of the San Quintín volcanic field to the north that overlie 5000-6000 year-old midden deposits (Rogers et al., 1985). The Holocene lava flows in the western part of this alkalic volcanic field are of basaltic-andesite and andesitic composition."
"Tortuga, Isla","-111.880,27.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036032.jpg","","A youthful shield volcano forms Isla Tortuga, which lies in the Gulf of California 40 km off the Baja coast. A circular, 1-km-wide caldera, west of the center of the oval, 4-km-long island, truncates the small shield volcano, which reaches only about 210 m above sea level. Circumferential faults cut the rim of the >100-m-deep caldera, which is floored by a solidified lava lake and contains youthful-looking spatter cones. The shield volcano was constructed during two north-migrating periods of activity that began with submarine eruptions and included formation of a circular tuff-ring complex enclosing the caldera. The sides of a small volcanic horst in the center of the caldera display lava flows overlying a 2-m-thick halite bed, formed when sea water filled the caldera, creating an evaporite basin. Recent lava flows cover most of the flanks of the volcano, and fumarolic activity has continued into historical time."
"Comondu-La Purisima","-111.920,26.000","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/102015.jpg","","The Comondú-La Purísima volcanic field, located in southern Baja California, west of the Sierra de la Giganta, dates back to the Miocene. However, the youthful morphology of some cinder cones suggested possible Holocene ages (Sawlan, 1991). The youngest lavas form blocky flows with flow ridges and are mostly located in the area between Comondú and the La Purísima river. Vents usually occur along NNW-trending faults, and many lava flows are offset, sometimes repeatedly, along grabens. Both basaltic and andesitic lava flows are present. The former are typically 5-10 m thick, and the latter are up to 60-80 m thick and form dense, glassy flows with subhorizontal fractures."
"Tres Virgenes","-112.591,27.470","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/074099.jpg","","The Tres Vírgenes volcanic complex contains the only large stratovolcanoes in Baja California. The roughly 1940-m-high complex rises above the Gulf of California in the east-central part of the peninsula. Three volcanoes, El Viejo, El Azufre, and La Vírgen were constructed along a NE-SW line and are progressively younger to the SW. The youngest volcano, La Vírgen, is an andesitic stratovolcano with numerous dacitic lava domes and lava flows on its flanks. A major plinian explosive eruption from a SW-flank vent was radiocarbon dated at about 6500 years ago, but Helium exposure and Uranium-series dates give a late-Pleistocene age for this event. An ash plume was reported from Tres Vírgenes volcano by a Spanish Jesuit priest while navigating the Gulf of California in 1746. No tephra deposits from such a young eruption have been found, but young undated andesitic lava flows at the summit could potentially be related to this event. A geothermal plant is located at the northern end of the complex near the margin of the Pleistocene El Aguajito caldera."
"Socorro","-110.950,18.780","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100009.jpg","","Socorro, the SE-most of the Revillagigedo Islands south of Baja California, is the summit of a massive, predominately submarine basaltic shield volcano capped by a largely buried, 4.5 x 3.8-km-wide summit caldera. A large tephra cone and lava dome complex, Cerro Evermann, forms the 1050-m-high summit of the volcano, and along with other cones and vents, fills much of the Pleistocene caldera. Rhyolitic lava domes have been constructed along flank rifts oriented to the north, west, and SE, and silicic lava flows from summit and flank vents have reached the coast and created an extremely irregular shoreline. Late-stage basaltic eruptions produced cones and flows near the coast. Only minor explosive activity, some of which is of uncertain validity, has occurred from flank vents in historical time dating back to the 19th century. In 1951 a brief phreatic eruption ejected blocks, and the gas column reached 1200 m elevation. A submarine eruption occurred during 1993-94 from a vent 3 km west of the island during which large scoriaceous blocks up to 5 m in size floated to the surface without associated explosive activity."
"Durango Volcanic Field","-104.450,24.150","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036048.jpg","","The broad Durango volcanic field covers 2100 sq km at the NW corner of the Meseta Central near the eastern edge of the Sierra Madre Occidental of north-central México.

The Durango volcanic field is dotted with about 100 Quaternary basanitic cinder and lava cones as well as several important xenolith localities. La Breña-El Jagüey maar complex consists of two intersecting maars, the largest of which (La Breña) contains a series of nested cinder cones. The maar complex is one of the youngest eruptive centers of the Durango volcanic field and was considered by Aranda-Gómez et al. (1992) to be only a few thousand years old."

Despite its apparent location at the western end of the Mexican Volcanic Belt, Isla Isabel consists of alkaline basaltic rocks and tephra similar to those of other Mexican island volcanoes and in the Northern Mexican Extensional Province. The island is a wildlife sanctuary whose rocks and vegetation are mantled with guano. Spectacular exposures of the interior of the tuff cones forming the island can be found in sea cliffs of the main island and offshore islets. The age of the most recent eruptive activity is not known, but morphology and a negative Argon-Argon age from a young sample suggests activity may have continued into the Holocene. One youthful-looking unvegetated lava flow of unknown age is located on the NW side of the island."
"Sanganguey","-104.730,21.450","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/055034.jpg","","Sangangüey, the highest volcano of the NW-SE-trending Tepic-Zacoalco graben, is an eroded andesitic and dacitic stratovolcano that contains a prominent lava spine at its summit. The NW and SE flanks of the Pleistocene edifice of Volcán Sangangüey are dotted with 45 cinder cones that erupted during the past 300,000 years along 5 parallel lines. Some of the cinder cones appear morphologically similar to cones on nearby Ceboruco volcano that are known to be less than 1000 years old. There are no confirmed historical eruptions from Sangangüey. An incorrect report of an eruption in 1859 from San Juan (a synonym of Sangangüey) refers to the nearby Pleistocene San Juan volcano. An Indian tradition records an eruption of Sangangüey in 1742 (Sapper, 1917). If these legends are true, they may refer to an eruption from one of the young flank cinder cones of Sangangüey."

San Benedicto island, elongated in a NE-SW direction, contains a series of Pleistocene trachytic lava domes at the north end. The southern end of the 4.5-km-long island is formed by Bárcena and Montículo Cinerítico, a smaller tephra cone that preceded and was largely overtopped by Bárcena. Montículo Cinerítico may also have been constructed during the past few hundred years and formed the high point of the island prior to the formation of Bárcena. Growth of the 300-m-high Bárcena tephra cone beginning in August 1952 was accompanied by strong explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows. The eruption concluded the following year with the emplacement of two small lava domes in the crater and extrusion of a prominent coastal lava delta at the SE base of the cone."
"Mascota Volcanic Field","-104.830,20.620","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/075077.jpg","","A group of calc-alkaline andesitic and minette cinder cones and lava domes, both with associated lava flows, is located near the town of Mascota, in the Jalisco tectonic block about 50 km east of Puerto Vallarta. Mascota is the youngest of a group of potassic volcanic fields in extensional grabens of the Jalisco block south of the Río Ameca. Most volcanism in the Mascota volcanic field is confined to two NNW-SSE-trending grabens cutting Cretaceous ash-flow tuffs. The youngest eruption, at Volcán Malpaís, north of Mascota, produced a fresh-looking basaltic-andesite lava flow. The lack of soil development and sparse vegetation suggest that it may be only a few thousand years old (Carmichael et al., 1996). The volcanic field is noted for its unusual diversity of volcanic rocks, and Mascota contains Earth's youngest known minettes, with radiometric ages down to 0.07 +/- 0.08 million years."
"Ceboruco","-104.508,21.125","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/036059.jpg","","Volcán Ceboruco is the only historically active volcano in the NW part of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. The complex stratovolcano rises above the floor of the Tepic graben and is truncated by two concentric summit calderas. Eruption of the voluminous rhyodacitic Jala Pumice, the largest known in México during the Holocene, formed the initial 4-km-wide caldera about 1000 years ago. The second caldera, 1.5 km wide, was formed by collapse of part of the large Dos Equis dacitic lava dome, which partly filled the earlier caldera. About 15 basaltic and andesitic cinder cones and lava flows have erupted along a NW-SE-trending line cutting across Ceboruco. The massive, sparsely vegetated El Norte lava flow, probably erupted in the past few hundred years, blankets the entire northern flank of the volcano. The last eruption of Ceboruco took place during 1870-75. Explosive eruptions from a vent on the upper west flank accompanied extrusion of a 1.1 cu km dacitic lava flow that covers a large area on the lower western flank."

It consists of two southward-younging volcanoes, Nevado de Colima (the 4320 m high point of the complex) on the north and the 3850-m-high historically active Volcán de Colima at the south. A group of cinder cones of late-Pleistocene age is located on the floor of the Colima graben west and east of the Colima complex. Volcán de Colima (also known as Volcán Fuego) is a youthful stratovolcano constructed within a 5-km-wide caldera, breached to the south, that has been the source of large debris avalanches. Major slope failures have occurred repeatedly from both the Nevado and Colima cones, and have produced a thick apron of debris-avalanche deposits on three sides of the complex. Frequent historical eruptions date back to the 16th century. Occasional major explosive eruptions (most recently in 1913) have destroyed the summit and left a deep, steep-sided crater that was slowly refilled and then overtopped by lava dome growth."

The Zitácuaro volcanic complex itself, located SE of the city, was constructed within the 30-km-wide Las Tres Chicas caldera of Miocene age, which later underwent three post-caldera episodes of intra-caldera lava dome resurgence and included the intrusion of dacitic central lava domes, the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and the eruption of andesitic lava flows. The youngest dated activity at the complex produced La Dieta airfall deposit about 31,000 years ago, and persistent local seismicity continues at Zitácuaro. The Valle de Bravo area to the south contains dominantly andesitic lava domes and flows, many of which were erupted along regional faults. The youngest flows were erupted at the bottom of a fault-controlled canyon; the most recent of these, west of the Valle de Bravo lake, has been Argon-Argon dated at about 5200 +/- 2300 years, and morphology suggests a Holocene age for other cones."

The 3900-m-high volcano was constructed during the Pleistocene of andesitic-to-dacitic lava flows. A major obsidian-bearing dacitic plinian eruption was followed by the emplacement of a dacitic lava-dome complex, accompanied by lava effusion, pumice-fall eruptions, and pyroclastic surges. The most prominent feature of the volcano is a horseshoe-shaped escarpment open to the NE that formed as a result of gravitational failure of the summit during the early Holocene. The resulting debris-avalanche deposit covers an 80 sq km area to the NE. Lava dome emplacement accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges subsequently filled much of the avalanche scarp. The latest known eruption occurred about 700 years ago and produced block-and-ash flows and pyroclastic surges."

A large dacitic lava dome in the crater separates two lakes, known as the lakes of the Sun and Moon. At least three major edifice collapses during the Pleistocene produced large debris-avalanche and lahar deposits that affected broad areas below the volcano. Four major explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene produced widespread ashfall and pyroclastic-flow deposits at about 36,000, 21,700, 12,100, and 10,500 years ago (uncalibrated 14C), producing the Ochre and the Lower, Middle, and Upper Toluca Pumice deposits, respectively.

Compound dome growth at Santiaguito has occurred episodically from four westward-younging vents, the most recent of which is Caliente. Dome growth has been accompanied by almost continuous minor explosions, with periodic lava extrusion, larger explosions, pyroclastic flows, and lahars."
"Almolonga","-91.519,14.797","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/038077.jpg","","Volcán de Almolonga is an andesitic stratovolcano with a 3.3-km-wide late-Pleistocene central caldera that is located along the Zunil fault zone. The caldera is surrounded by a ring-dike configuration of dacitic and rhyolitic lava domes. The youngest and only historically active dome complex is Cerro Quemado (whose name means Burned Peak), located immediately south of Guatemala's second largest city, Quezaltenango. About 1200 radiocarbon years ago, part of the andesitic-to-dacitic Cerro Quemado dome collapsed, producing a debris avalanche and an associated lateral explosion that swept across the valley to the west as far as the flanks of Siete Orejas volcano. The latest eruption in 1818 produced a blocky 2.5-km-long lava flow. Hot springs are located on the northern and eastern flanks of Cerro Quemado, and the Zuníl geothermal field, the site of a geothermal exploration project, lies on the SE flank of Cerro Quemado."
"Atitlan","-91.186,14.583","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/078053.jpg","","Volcán Atitlán is one of several prominent conical stratovolcanoes in the Guatemalan highlands. Along with its twin volcano Tolimán to the north, it forms a dramatic backdrop to Lake Atitlán, one of the scenic highlights of the country. The 3535-m-high summit directly overlies the inferred margin of the Pleistocene Atitlán III caldera and is the highest of three large post-caldera stratovolcanoes constructed near the southern caldera rim. The volcano consequently post-dates the eruption of the voluminous, roughly 85,000-year-old rhyolitic Los Chocoyos tephra associated with formation of the Atitlán III caldera. The historically active andesitic Volcán Atitlán is younger than Tolimán, although their earlier activity overlapped. In contrast to Tolimán, Atitlán displays a thick pyroclastic cover. The northern side of the volcano is wooded to near the summit, whereas the upper 1000 m of the southern slopes are unvegetated. Predominantly explosive eruptions have been recorded from Volcán Atitlán since the 15th century."
"Toliman","-91.189,14.612","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/078052.jpg","http://amenazas.sgc.gov.co/ovsm/camip-lasmarias/vnt01-2.jpg","Volcán Tolimán is a large andesitic stratovolcano that rises above the south shore of Lake Atitlán. Tolimán was constructed within the Pleistocene Atitlán III caldera, near its inferred southern margin. A shallow elliptical crater truncates the summit, and a minor subsidiary peak to the SSW also has a shallow crater. In contrast to the tephra-covered surface of its twin volcano to the south, Volcán Atitlán, the surface of Tolimán is draped by prominent thick lava flows. Many of the flows were erupted from vents on the volcano's flanks and form a highly irregular shoreline on the south side of Lake Atitlán. No historical eruptions are known from Tolimán. However, a lava flow that entered Lake Atitlán from the parasitic lava dome of Cerro de Oro on the northern flank was considered by Newhall et al. (1987) to be less than a few thousand years old based on the thickness of sediment accumulated on the sublacustral part of the flow."
"Acatenango","-90.876,14.501","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/078080.jpg","","Acatenango, along with its twin volcano to the south, Volcán Fuego, overlooks the historic former capital city of Antigua, Guatemala. Acatenango, which has two principal summits, was constructed during three eruptive periods post-dating the roughly 85,000-year-old Los Chocoyos tephra from Atitlán caldera. An ancestral Acatenango volcano collapsed to the south sometime prior to 43,000 years ago, forming La Democracia debris-avalanche deposit, which covers a wide area of the Pacific coastal plain. Construction of Yepocapa, the northern summit of Acatenango, was completed about 20,000 years ago, after which growth of the southern and highest cone, Pico Central (also known as Pico Mayor), began. The first well-documented eruptions of Acatenango took place from 1924 to 1927, although earlier historical eruptions may have occurred. Francisco Vasquez, writing in 1690, noted that in 1661 a volcano that lay aside of Fuego 'opened a smoking mouth and still gives off smoke from another three, but without noise.""
"Fuego","-90.880,14.473","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/039003.jpg","http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/geofisica/vulcanologia/Fuego.jpg","Volcán Fuego, one of Central America's most active volcanoes, is one of three large stratovolcanoes overlooking Guatemala's former capital, Antigua. The scarp of an older edifice, Meseta, lies between 3763-m-high Fuego and its twin volcano to the north, Acatenango. Construction of Meseta dates back to about 230,000 years and continued until the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Collapse of Meseta may have produced the massive Escuintla debris-avalanche deposit, which extends about 50 km onto the Pacific coastal plain. Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at Acatenango. In contrast to the mostly andesitic Acatenango, eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks. Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows."
"Agua","-90.743,14.465","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/046038.jpg","","The symmetrical, forested Volcán de Agua stratovolcano forms an impressive backdrop to the historic former capital city of Antigua Guatemala, opposite the twin volcanoes of Fuego and Acatenango. The 3760-m-high basaltic-andesite to andesite Agua volcano has an isolated position that makes it a prominent landmark from all directions. A small, 280-m-wide circular crater is breached on the NNE side. Six small pit craters are located on the NW flank, and two small cones lie on the south flank. Agua's symmetrical profile implies a relatively young age, although currently no dated Holocene tephra deposits are known. Agua has had no historical eruptions, but its name (the water volcano) originates from a devastating mudflow on September 11, 1541. The mudflow destroyed the first Guatemalan capital city established by the Spanish Conquistadors, which is now known as Ciudad Vieja. The catastrophe prompted the establishment of a new capital city at nearby Antigua."
"Cuilapa-Barbarena","-90.400,14.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040023.jpg","","The Cuilapa-Barbarena volcanic field contains approximately 70 Quaternary cinder cones, generally less than 100 m high. Many of the mostly basaltic cones are located along the strike of the major regional Jalpatagua fault, which extends SE from Guatemala City, north of the chain of stratovolcanoes stretching across Guatemala. The cones were erupted from fracture systems related to the intersection of the Jalpatagua fault with the southern and western margins of the Miocene Santa Rosa de Lima caldera and overlie pyroclastic-flow deposits from Amatitlán caldera to the NW. The age of the most recent eruptions is not known, although the youngest cones post-date the last phase of eruptive activity at Tecuamburro volcano and could be of Holocene age (Reynolds, 1987). Williams (1960) considered the most recent eruptions to have occurred within the last few thousand years."
"Pacaya","-90.601,14.381","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/079002.jpg","","Eruptions from Pacaya, one of Guatemala's most active volcanoes, are frequently visible from Guatemala City, the nation's capital. This complex basaltic volcano was constructed just outside the southern topographic rim of the 14 x 16 km Pleistocene Amatitlán caldera. A cluster of dacitic lava domes occupies the southern caldera floor. The post-caldera Pacaya massif includes the ancestral Pacaya Viejo and Cerro Grande stratovolcanoes and the currently active Mackenney stratovolcano. Collapse of Pacaya Viejo between 600 and 1500 years ago produced a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 25 km onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the modern Pacaya volcano (Mackenney cone) grew. A subsidiary crater, Cerro Chino, was constructed on the NW somma rim and was last active in the 19th century. During the past several decades, activity has consisted of frequent strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion that has partially filled in the caldera moat and armored the flanks of Mackenney cone, punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions that partially destroy the summit of the growing young stratovolcano."
"Jumaytepeque","-90.269,14.336","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118051.jpg","","Jumaytepeque is a small basaltic stratovolcano located NNE of the city of Cuilapa, north of the major NW-SE-trending Jalpatagua fault that cuts diagonally across SE Guatemala. The 1815-m-high volcano was constructed near the SE rim of the large Miocene Santa Rosa de Lima caldera. Jumaytepeque volcano is not overlain by a ca. 23,000-year-old tephra unit from nearby Ayarza caldera, and its erosionally unmodified form suggests that Holocene activity is possible (Reynolds 2007, pers. comm.). Two older cinder cones to the north are covered with Ayarza tephra."
"Tecuamburro","-90.407,14.156","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040024.jpg","","Tecuamburro is a small, forested stratovolcano or large lava-dome complex of mostly Pleistocene age. It is located about 50 km ESE of Guatemala City, about 20 km south of the main volcanic chain. An ancestral andesitic stratovolcano, Miraflores, was formed about 100,000 years ago. Tecuamburro and other lava domes were constructed during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene within a horseshoe-shaped, east-facing caldera produced by structural failure of the older Miraflores stratovolcano prior to about 38,000 years ago. One of the largest of these domes, Peña Blanca, overtops the NW rim of the collapse scarp. Two nested craters, the larger of which is Chupadero, lie at the NW end of the complex. The smaller crater is a phreatic tuff ring, Laguna Ixpaco, that was formed about 2900 years ago during the latest dated eruption of the Tecuamburro complex. Numerous fumaroles, hot springs, and boiling mud pots are found in the area around the acidic lake. No historical eruptions are known from Tecuamburro."
"Moyuta","-90.100,14.030","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040033.jpg","","Moyuta is the easternmost of a chain of large stratovolcanoes extending along the volcanic front of Guatemala. Like Tecuamburro volcano, Moyuta is offset about 20 km south of the main volcanic chain and lies south of the Jalpatagua Fault, overlying the southern boundary of the Jalpatagua Graben. The 1662-m-high volcano is capped by a cluster of at least three forested, steep-sided, coalescing andesitic lava domes that from some distant perspectives give the summit a flat-topped appearance. Numerous cinder cones in various stages of erosion are located on the flanks of the complex. The age of the latest eruption of Moyuta volcano is not known, although the summit domes were considered to have been emplaced in relatively recent times (Williams et al., 1964). Small fumaroles are found on the northern and southern flanks of the volcano, and hot springs are located near Azulco at the NE base and along rivers on the SE side of Moyuta."

Volcán de Flores, also known as Volcán Amayo, lies about 10 km west of the city of Jutiapa, at the SW end of the SE Guatemala volcanic platform. The 1600-m-high summit rises up to 600 m above a basement of Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks and contains a shallow crater breached on its eastern side. Satellitic cones occur at the southern and eastern base of the dominantly basaltic Flores volcano. Youthful lava flows occur at the NE base of the volcano, near El Aguacite."
"Tahual","-89.900,14.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040038.jpg","","Deeply dissected Volcán Tahual rises about 700 m above plains south of the town of Monjas. The summit of the 1716-m-high forested stratovolcano is cut by a broad erosional crater that extends to the base of the volcano and is narrowly breached to the NE. A Holocene pyroclastic cone near the NE base of Volcán Tahual fed a short basaltic lava flow (Williams et al., 1964). The scenic lake-filled Laguna de Hoyo lies north of the volcano. This steep-walled crater and the NE-flank cinder cone lie along faults bordering a graben that extends across the eastern base of the volcano to neighboring Retana caldera on the SE."
"Santiago, Cerro","-89.870,14.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/077055.jpg","","A cluster of cinder cones and low shield volcanoes surrounds the city of Jutiapa in SE Guatemala. The most prominent feature is Cerro Santiago, one of two coalescing cinder cones capping a low shield volcano SE of Jutiapa. Youthful flows from the twin Los Cerritos cones NE of Jutiapa cross the Interamerican highway. Volcán Culma forms a steep-sided basaltic lava mound immediately east of the city. To the west lies Cerro Gordo (referred to by Williams et al., 1964 as Volcano Amayo), a craterless cinder cone surrounded by basaltic lava flows. It is one of several cinder cones to have produced lava flows that blanket the landscape between Jutiapa and Tertiary volcanic hills to the south."
"Suchitan","-89.780,14.400","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040035.jpg","","Volcán Suchitán, NE of the city of Jutiapa, is one of the largest volcanoes in SE Guatemala. The 2042-m-high summit of the andesitic-to-basaltic stratovolcano is elongated in a N-S direction. Several large canyons cut the slopes of the dominantly andesitic edifice. A large parasitic cone, Cerro Mataltepe, is located on the upper northern flank, and two smaller cones are located on the lower northern flank. Two basaltic lava flows of Holocene age are located on the northern and NW flanks (Williams et al., 1964), and many flank vents are basaltic. Suchitán was constructed immediately to the east of the 5-km-wide basaltic-to-dacitic Retana caldera, formed in part in association with the eruption of a dacitic pumice deposit. Steep walls 60-250-m high rise above the flat caldera floor. One of the latest basaltic lava flows from Suchitán flowed through a low notch in the eastern caldera rim. Several lava cones and a maar are located along a N-S line north of Retana caldera. A reported eruption of Suchitán in 1469 is considered to have actually been from Atitlán volcano in the Guatemalan highlands."
"Chingo","-89.730,14.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/073086.jpg","","Volcán Chingo is a symmetrical stratovolcano that straddles the Guatemala/El Salvador border. The 1775-m-high conical volcano rises 900 m above its surroundings and is the most prominent regional landmark. A shallow, oval-shaped summit crater is breached on the western side. No historical eruptions are known from the Volcán Chingo volcanic field. Other small stratovolcanoes and cinder cones are located on both sides of the volcano along a major N-S-trending fault. Other youthful cones, such as Cerro de Olla, lie across the Salvadorian border to the south. To the north in Guatemala, Volcán las Viboras, a cinder cone that caps a basaltic shield volcano, is the most prominent of several fault-controlled cones near Laguna Atescatempo. Flank fissures have fed many youthful lava flows, particularly on the western flank of Chingo and the northern flank of Volcán las Viboras."
"Ixtepeque","-89.680,14.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040039.jpg","","Ixtepeque volcano, which takes its name from the Aztec word for obsidian, is perhaps the largest obsidian field in North America. A 4 x 5 km wide rhyolitic obsidian lava field was erupted within the Ipala graben from a craterless vent along a NE-trending fissure that passes through adjacent rhyolitic lava domes and basaltic cinder cones. Obsidian from Ixtepeque has shown up at archaeological sites across Central America. Flat-lying pumice beds produced by explosive eruptions preceding lava effusion are found locally around the volcano. Other obsidian flows originated from lava domes NE of Ixtepeque. These rhyolitic vents are interspersed with basaltic cinder cones and lava flows. Laguna de Obrajuelo is a complex cone cut by a large crater more than a km in diameter. Initial basaltic eruptions were followed by the extrusion of obsidian flows and the eruption of rhyolitic pumice that were considered by Williams et al. (1964) to be only a few thousand years old."
"Ipala","-89.630,14.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040040.jpg","","Ipala is a small but prominent stratovolcano that extends nearly across the full width of the Ipala graben and rises 750 m above the graben floor. The 1650-m-high summit of Volcán Ipala is truncated by a 1-km-wide crater whose steep, 150-m-high walls tower above a lake. A prominent parasitic cone, Monte Rico, is located on the southern flank; it and other cones on the northern flank lie along a N-S-trending fracture that continues well beyond the southern flank of the volcano. The eastern flank of Ipala is cut by a 17-km long, NNE-SSW fissure that produced a conspicuous line of Holocene cinder cones that fed basaltic lava flows covering about 20 sq km. Diaz reported that in 1865 Ipala ejected ash from January 24 to June. He listed no source and the report seems improbable (Incer 1988, unpublished manuscript)."
"Chiquimula Volcanic Field","-89.550,14.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/077064.jpg","","The Chiquimula volcanic field occupies a fault-bounded basin underlain by Cretaceous plutonic rocks in the Chiquimula Valley of SE Guatemala. Initial eruptions during the Pleistocene produced mesa-forming basaltic lava flows along the N-S-trending fault forming the eastern edge of the Ipala graben. These were followed by the eruption of widespread lava flows NW of Chiquimula town that covered about 12 sq km. The most recent eruptions produced basaltic cinder cones and lava flows near the northern edge of Chiquimula town. The cinder cones were constructed along a N-S-trending fracture, with Cerro Grande at the northern end being the largest and Cerro Chiquito at the southern end being the youngest. The lava flows from Cerro Chiquito are so fresh and sparsely vegetated they were considered by Williams et al. (1964) to possibly be less than 1000 years old."

The flows were considered to be of Holocene age by Williams et al. (1964)."
"Santo Tomas","-91.479,14.710","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/078041.jpg","","Volcán Santo Tomás (also known as Volcán Pecul) is a large eroded stratovolcano located across a valley SE of Santa María volcano. The summit of the volcano is capped by late-Quaternary andesitic tephra. A winding ridge connects Santo Tomás to Volcán de Zunil, 4.5 km to the NE, a 3542-m-high stratovolcano that forms the topographic high point of the Santo Tomás - Zunil complex. Volcán de Zunil is located on the SW rim of the 4-km-wide, 600-m-deep Tzanjuyub caldera, which is breached to the south by the Río Masa. Several dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes are located on the caldera's northern flank and the NW flank of Volcán de Zunil. The youngest dome, Cerro Zunil, was last active about 84,000 years ago (K-Ar dating). No Holocene eruptions are known from Santo Tomás, although it was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Mooser et al., 1958) based on its geothermal activity. Solfataras and thermal springs are located on the west side of the ridge between Santo Tomás and Zunil."
"San Diego","-89.480,14.270","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/073078.jpg","","An extensive volcanic field of fresh-looking basaltic cinder cones and barren lava flows near Lake Güija, which straddles the border between El Salvador and Guatemala, is named after its largest feature, 781-m-high Volcán de San Diego. A large basaltic lava flow from the San Diego cinder cone dammed the drainage and was responsible for the formation of Lake Güija. Volcanism is concentrated in two areas near Lake Güija--an area of volcanic cones including San Diego east of the lake, and an area of small cones north of the lake near the Guatemalan border, north of the Río Ostua. None of the eruptions in the San Diego volcanic field have been dated, but Williams and McBirney (1955) estimated that the latest eruption occurred within the past few thousand years. Quaternary volcanic rocks are also located across Lake Güija in Guatemala."
"Singuil, Cerro","-89.650,14.050","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/073067.jpg","","The most prominent feature of a volcanic field in the interior valley of El Salvador near the Guatemalan border SE of Volcán Chingo is Cerro Singüil. This 957-m-high scoria cone, also known as El Cerron, has a well-preserved summit crater and is part of a group of cinder cones and explosion craters mapped as Holocene in age by Weber and Wiesemann (1978). A young basaltic lava flow extends to the NNE down the valley of the Quebada La Presa, the headwaters of the Río Guajoyo. The volcanic field includes a line of three NNE-trending explosion craters north of the city of Chalchuapa, the highest of which is 1035-m-high Cerro Tablas."
"Apaneca Range","-89.786,13.891","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/077031.jpg","","The Apaneca Range (also known as the Cuyanausul Range) consists of an elongated group of roughly E-W-trending basaltic-to-andesitic Pleistocene and Holocene stratovolcanoes in western El Salvador between the Santa Ana complex and the Guatemala border. The 5 x 3.5 km wide Pleistocene dacitic-rhyolitic Concepción de Ataco caldera lies at the western end of the complex, along with post-caldera late-Pleistocene to Holocene andesitic-dacitic lava domes. The post-caldera cones of Cerro el Aguila (at 2036 m the highest peak of the complex) and Cerro los Naranjos volcano at the eastern end of the chain were mapped as Holocene by Weber and Weisemann (1978). Young craters on basaltic Laguna Verde stratovolcano may also have been active during the Holocene. Numerous fumarole fields are located on the northern flank of the range, and the Ahuachapán geothermal field has been producing since 1975. Several small hydrothermal explosions have occurred in historical time, including one in October 1990 at the Agua Shuca thermal area in which 26 persons were killed."
"Santa Ana","-89.630,13.853","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040042.jpg","","Santa Ana, El Salvador's highest volcano, is a massive, 2381-m-high, dominantly andesitic-to-trachyandesitic stratovolcano that rises immediately west of Coatepeque caldera. Collapse of Santa Ana (also known as Ilamatepec) during the late Pleistocene produced a voluminous debris avalanche that swept into the Pacific Ocean, forming the Acajutla Peninsula. Reconstruction of the volcano subsequently filled most of the collapse scarp. The broad summit of the volcano is cut by several crescentic craters, and a series of parasitic vents and cones have formed along a 20-km-long fissure system that extends from near the town of Chalchuapa NNW of the volcano to the San Marcelino and Cerro la Olla cinder cones on the SE flank. Historical activity, largely consisting of small-to-moderate explosive eruptions from both summit and flank vents, has been documented since the 16th century. The San Marcelino cinder cone on the SE flank produced a lava flow in 1722 that traveled 13 km to the east."
"Izalco","-89.633,13.813","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/046046.jpg","","Volcán de Izalco, El Salvador's youngest volcano, was born in in 1770 CE on the southern flank of Santa Ana volcano. Frequent strombolian eruptions from Izalco provided a night-time beacon for ships, causing the volcano to be known as El Faro, the 'Lighthouse of the Pacific.' During the two centuries prior to the cessation of activity in 1966, Izalco built a steep-sided, 650-m-high stratovolcano truncated by a 250-m-wide summit crater. Izalco has been one of the most frequently active volcanoes in North America, and its sparsely vegetated slopes contrast dramatically with neighboring forested volcanoes. Izalco's dominantly basaltic-andesite pyroclasts and lava flows are geochemically distinct from those of both Santa Ana and its fissure-controlled flank vents. Lava flows were mostly erupted from flank vents and deflected southward by the slopes of Santa Ana, traveling as far as about 7 km from the summit of Izalco."
"Coatepeque Caldera","-89.550,13.870","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/100077.jpg","","The 7 x 10 km Coatepeque caldera, its eastern side filled by a caldera lake, was formed by collapse of a group of stratovolcanoes immediately east of Santa Ana volcano. The height of the caldera rim increases to 800 m on the west, where it partially truncates Santa Ana volcano. The caldera was formed during a series of major rhyolitic explosive eruptions between about 72,000 and 51,000 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions included the formation of basaltic cinder cones and lava flows near the western margin of the caldera and the extrusion of a half dozen rhyodacitic lava domes along a NE-SW line near the caldera lake margins. The highest of the domes forms the wooded island of Isla de Cabra, or Cerro Grande. The age of the domes is not known precisely, but the youngest dome, Cerro Pacho, was estimated to have formed less than 10,000 years ago. Hot springs occur near the lake margins, but no verified historical eruptions have occurred from Coatepeque."

The 1438-m-high basaltic volcano has no trace of its original summit crater, and deep canyons cut its flanks. Several young Holocene pyroclastic cones and lava flows of similar composition are found at the base of the volcano (Williams and Meyer-Abich, 1955). The Macanze scoria cone at the SE base of the volcano was considered to have probably been active only a few thousand years ago, however Weber and Wiesemann (1978) did not map Holocene vents in this area."
"San Salvador","-89.294,13.734","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/073049.jpg","","The massive compound San Salvador volcano dominates the landscape west of El Salvador's capital city of San Salvador. The dominantly andesitic Boquerón stratovolcano has grown within a 6-km-wide caldera, whose rim is partially exposed at Picacho and Jabalí peaks, that formed by collapse of an older San Salvador volcano about 40,000 years ago. The summit of Boquerón is truncated by a steep-walled crater 1.5 km wide and about 500 m deep that formed during a major eruption about 800 years ago. It contained a crater lake prior to an eruption during 1917 that formed a small cinder cone on the crater floor; a major north-flank lava flow also erupted in this year. Three fracture zones that extend beyond the base of San Salvador volcano have been the locus for numerous flank eruptions, including two that formed maars on the WNW and SE sides. Most of the four historical eruptions recorded since the 16th century have originated from flank vents, including two in the 17th century from the NW-flank cone of El Playón, during which explosions and a lava flow damaged inhabited areas."
"Ilopango","-89.053,13.672","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/072013.jpg","","The scenic 8 x 11 km Ilopango caldera, filled by one of El Salvador's largest lakes, has a scalloped 150-500 m high rim. The caldera, which lies immediately east of the capital city of San Salvador, is strongly controlled by regional faults of the central Salvador graben. Four major dacitic-rhyolitic explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene and Holocene produced extensive pyroclastic-flow and pyroclastic-fall deposits that blanket much of El Salvador. The latest collapse resulted from the massive 5th century CE Terra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption, which produced widespread pyroclastic flows and devastated early Mayan cities. Post-caldera eruptions formed a series of glassy dacitic and andesitic lava domes within the lake and near its shore. The Islas Quemadas, a group of low islets in the center of the lake that mark the summit of a largely submerged lava dome, were formed in 1879-80 during the only historical eruption of Ilopango."
"Apastepeque Field","-88.770,13.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/072069.jpg","","The Apastepeque volcanic field north of the city of San Vicente consists of a dense cluster of about two dozen chemically diverse Holocene volcanic vents, including lava domes, cinder cones, and maars. Andesitic-to-dacitic lava domes were emplaced in some vents following dacitic pumice eruptions. After the end of these more siliceous eruptions, a series of basaltic cinder cones was formed. Some of the basaltic eruptions concluded with the formation of steep-walled maars up to 100 m deep, some now occupied by lakes, such as Laguna de Apastepeque and Laguna Chalchuapán."
"Taburete","-88.532,13.435","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/076029.jpg","","Taburete volcano rises above the Pacific coastal plain east of the Río Lempa at the SW end of a cluster of volcanoes between San Vincente and San Miguel volcanoes. Basaltic to basaltic-andesite Volcán Taburete is elongated in a NW-SE direction and overlaps with Tecapa volcano to the NE. The 1172-m-high summit of Taburete forms a prominent peak that rises about 170 m above the southern crater rim. A well-preserved, 150-300 m deep summit crater has a low point on its eastern rim. A fairly recent lava flow descends the southern flank of the volcano (Williams and McBirney, 1955). Loma Pacha cone on the lower SE flank fed a thick lava flow that traveled 1 km to the SE. The age of the most recent eruption of Taburete is not precisely known, and Weber and Wiesemann (1978) did not map Holocene deposits from Taburete."
"San Vicente","-88.837,13.595","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040059.jpg","","The twin peaks of San Vicente volcano, also known as Chichontepec, rise dramatically to the SE of Lake Ilopango. The modern andesitic stratovolcano was constructed within the Pleistocene La Carbonera caldera, whose rim is visible only on its SW side. San Vicente volcano, the second highest in El Salvador, grew within the caldera to form a paired volcano with summit craters oriented along a WSW-ENE line. The northern and southern flanks are covered by lava flows from the central vent, but lava flows on the eastern side originated from a vent on the upper flank. Volcanism has continued into the Holocene, but the latest lava flows are covered by deposits from the major ca. 260 CE eruption from neighboring Ilopango. Reports of historical eruptions in 1643 and 1835 are false (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World; Sapper, 1917), but numerous hot springs and fumaroles are found on the northern and western flanks."

"Tigre, El","-88.430,13.470","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040066.jpg","","Cerro el Tigre is the highest, NE-most, and oldest of the cluster of coalescing basaltic to basaltic-andesite Quaternary volcanoes between the Río Lempa and San Miguel volcano. The summit crater of El Tigre has been destroyed by erosion, and the flanks of the volcano are deeply dissected. Two large NNW-trending valleys, parallel to other regional fissures, cross the volcano, which lies about 7 km SE of Tecapa volcano and a similar distance NE of Usulután volcano. Although El Tigre itself is Pleistocene in age, two young cones on its flanks were mapped as Holocene by Weber and Wiesemann (1978). Cerro Oromontique and Cerro la Manita were erupted on the western and southern flanks of El Tigre, respectively, along a NW-SE-trending fissure extending towards Tecapa volcano."

The Berlín caldera, whose rim is visible on the west side of the complex, was formed during the eruption of the Blanca-Rosa dacitic pumice in the late Pleistocene. Following caldera formation the cones of Cerro Las Palmas, Cerro Pelón, Tecapa-Laguna de Alegria, and Cerro Alegria were constructed along a WSW-ENE line. The crater of Tecapa-Laguna de Alegria contains a deep notch on the eastern rim and is filled by Laguna de Alegria crater lake. The Tecapa volcanic complex currently displays fumarolic activity, and a producing geothermal plant is located at the Berlín geothermal field."

A 2-km-wide, steep-sided caldera, Laguna Seca el Pacayal, truncates the 1300-m-high summit of Chinameca volcano, whose flanks are draped with coffee plantations. The Holocene cone of Cerro el Limbo on the western flank rises to 1380 m, above the level of the caldera rim, and a Holocene lava flow extends from a NNW-flank vent into the lowlands to the north beyond the town of Chinameca (Weber and Weisemann, 1978). A group of fumarole fields is located on the north flank of the volcano surrounds the city of Chinameca, and the volcano has been the site of a geothermal exploration program."

The Pan-American highway swings around the south side of the maar immediately north of the Río Grande de San Miguel. Laguna Aramuaca was mapped as Holocene by Weber and Wiesemann (1978), but has not been studied in detail. The low rim of the maar rises about 50-100 m above the countryside and reaches only 181 m above sea level. Spectacular pyroclastic-surge deposits are exposed by quarries near the rim of the maar."

The unvegetated summit of the 2130-m-high volcano rises above slopes draped with coffee plantations. A broad, deep crater complex that has been frequently modified by historical eruptions (recorded since the early 16th century) caps the truncated summit, also known locally as Chaparrastique. Radial fissures on the flanks of the basaltic-andesitic volcano have fed a series of historical lava flows, including several erupted during the 17th-19th centuries that reached beyond the base of the volcano on the north, NE, and SE sides. The SE-flank lava flows are the largest and form broad, sparsely vegetated lava fields crossed by highways and a railroad skirting the base of the volcano. The location of flank vents has migrated higher on the edifice during historical time, and the most recent activity has consisted of minor ash eruptions from the summit crater."

At least seven satellitic cones, some of which form small islands offshore, are located from the NE to SE base of the broad 640-m-high basaltic stratovolcano. Some of these, including the symmetrical cone of Isla Gueguensi in the tidal flats about 3 km east of the base of Zacate Grande, are of probable Holocene age (Carr 1992, pers. comm.). In contrast to neighboring Isla El Tigre volcano to the south, Zacate Grande itself is extensively eroded, and deep valleys extend from the summit ridges to the base of the volcano."
"Yojoa, Lake","-87.980,14.980","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/081057.jpg","","The Lake Yojoa volcanic field consists a group of Pleistocene-to-Holocene scoria cones and collapse pits at the northern end of the scenic north-central Honduras lake (Williams and McBirney, 1969). The volcanic field has produced rocks ranging from tholeiitic basalts to trachybasalts, trachyandesites, and trachytes. The principal NE-trending chain of cones cuts through Cerro Babilonia, the 1090 m high point of the volcanic field, along the same fault pattern that bounds the limestone mountains bordering arcuate Lake Yojoa. Most of the pyroclastic cones, consisting of basaltic scoria and agglutinate, are 100-200 m in height and several contain well-preserved craters. Lava flows radiate in all directions from the cones. The longest flow traveled northward to the village of Río Lindo, where a waterfall cascades down the terminus of the flow. A few Quaternary lava flows occur in the Sulu graben along the Carretara del Norte north of Lake Yojoa."

Utila is capped by a thin veneer of Holocene basaltic rocks at its eastern end (McBirney and Bass, 1969). Basaltic lavas and tuffs were erupted onto a coral-capped erosional surface. Stuert Hill (also spelled Stuart Hill) is a pyroclastic cone that was constructed at the center of the volcanic terrain, and Pumpkin Hill is a small littoral cone located along the NE coast of the island. The high point of the island is Pumpkin Hill, which rises only 74 m above sea level."
"Cosiguina","-87.570,12.980","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/040083.jpg","","Cosigüina is a low basaltic-to-andesitic composite volcano that is isolated from other eruptive centers in the Nicaraguan volcanic chain. The 872-m-high stratovolcano forms a large peninsula extending into the Gulf of Fonseca at the western tip of the country. Cosigüina (also spelled Cosegüina) has a pronounced somma rim on the northern side; a young summit cone of Cosigüina rises 300 m above the northern somma rim and buries the rim on other sides. The younger cone is truncated by a large elliptical prehistorical summit caldera, 2 x 2.4 km in diameter and 500 m deep, with a lake at its bottom. Lava flows predominate in the caldera walls, although lahar and pyroclastic-flow deposits surround the volcano. In 1835 Cosigüina was the source of a brief, but powerful explosive eruption that was Nicaragua's largest during historical time. Ash fell as far away as México, Costa Rica, and Jamaica, and pyroclastic flows reached the Gulf of Fonseca."

The symmetrical 1745-m-high youngest cone, named San Cristóbal (also known as El Viejo), is Nicaragua's highest volcano and is capped by a 500 x 600 m wide crater. El Chonco, with several flank lava domes, is located 4 km W of San Cristóbal; it and the eroded Moyotepe volcano, 4 km NE of San Cristóbal, are of Pleistocene age. Volcán Casita, containing an elongated summit crater, lies immediately east of San Cristóbal and was the site of a catastrophic landslide and lahar in 1998. The Plio-Pleistocene La Pelona caldera is located at the eastern end of the complex. Historical eruptions from San Cristóbal, consisting of small-to-moderate explosive activity, have been reported since the 16th century. Some other 16th-century eruptions attributed to Casita volcano are uncertain and may pertain to other Marrabios Range volcanoes."

This volcano group consists of several interlocking cones and vents with a general NW alignment. Sixteenth-century eruptions were reported at symmetrical Santa Clara volcano at the SW end of the group. However, its eroded and breached crater has been covered by forests throughout historical time, and these eruptions may have originated from Telica, whose upper slopes in contrast are unvegetated. The steep-sided cone of 1061-m-high Telica is truncated by a 700-m-wide double crater; the southern crater, the source of recent eruptions, is 120 m deep. El Liston, immediately SE of Telica, has several nested craters. The fumaroles and boiling mudpots of Hervideros de San Jacinto, SE of Telica, form a prominent geothermal area frequented by tourists, and geothermal exploration has occurred nearby."
"Rota","-86.750,12.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/082046.jpg","","The deeply eroded, forested Rota stratovolcano of Holocene age occupies the area between Cerro Negro volcano and the Telica volcanic complex in the central Marrabios Range.

The latest eruption from Rota produced thick andesitic lava flows from a NE-trending fissure NW of the summit. No historical eruptions are known from Volcán Rota, and Williams and McBirney (1965) considered the volcano to have been quiescent for many centuries. Seismic swarms occurred in 1986, 1989, and 1992. Two small NNW-SSE-trending lava domes, El Bosque (also known as Lomas San Ignacio del Bosque or Cerro Ojochal) are located on the plain 2 km north of the flank of Rota. They were constructed along the same trend as other eruptive fissures that extend transverse to the Marrabios Range volcanoes. An extensive lava field in this area was erupted from numerous small cones and maars."

Cerro Negro is the largest, southernmost, and most recent of a group of four youthful cinder cones constructed along a NNW-SSE-trending line in the central Marrabios Range 5 km NW of Las Pilas volcano. Strombolian-to-subplinian eruptions at Cerro Negro at intervals of a few years to several decades have constructed a roughly 250-m-high basaltic cone and an associated lava field that is constrained by topography to extend primarily to the NE and SW. Cone and crater morphology at Cerro Negro have varied significantly during its eruptive history. Although Cerro Negro lies in a relatively unpopulated area, its occasional heavy ashfalls have caused damage to crops and buildings in populated regions of the Nicaraguan depression."
"Pilas, Las","-86.688,12.495","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/041056.jpg","","Las Pilas volcanic complex, overlooking Cerro Negro volcano to the NW, includes a diverse cluster of cones around the central vent, Las Pilas. A N-S-trending fracture system cutting across 1088-m-high Las Pilas (El Hoyo) is marked by numerous well-preserved flank vents, including maars, that are part of a 30-km-long volcanic massif. The Cerro Negro chain of cinder cones is listed separately in this compilation because of its extensive historical eruptions. The lake-filled Asososca maar is located adjacent to the conical 818-m-high Cerro Asososca cone on the southern side of the fissure system, south of the axis of the Marrabios Range. Two small maars west of Lake Managua are located at the southern end of the fissure. Aside from a possible eruption in the 16th century, the only historical eruptions of Las Pilas took place in the 1950s from a fissure that cuts the eastern side of the 700-m-wide summit crater and extends down the north flank."
"Apoyeque","-86.342,12.242","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/041074.jpg","","The Apoyeque volcanic complex occupies the broad Chiltepe Peninsula, which extends into south-central Lake Managua. The peninsula is part of the Chiltepe pyroclastic shield volcano, one of three large ignimbrite shields on the Nicaraguan volcanic front. A 2.8-km wide, 400-m-deep, lake-filled caldera whose floor lies near sea level truncates the low Apoyeque volcano, which rises only about 500 m above the lake shore. The caldera was the source of a thick mantle of dacitic pumice that blankets the surrounding area. The 2.5 x 3 km wide lake-filled Xiloá (Jiloá) maar, is located immediately SE of Apoyeque. The Talpetatl lava dome was constructed between Laguna Xiloá and Lake Managua. Pumiceous pyroclastic flows from Laguna Xiloá were erupted about 6100 years ago and overlie deposits of comparable age from the Masaya plinian eruption."

This alignment, which has erupted tholeiitic basaltic rocks similar to those from mid-ocean ridges, marks the right-lateral offset of the Nicaraguan volcanic chain. A series of pit craters and fissure vents extends into Lake Managua and is continuous with the volcanic vents on the Chiltepe peninsula. An area of maars and tuff cones perpendicular to the N-S trend of the lineament forms the scalloped shoreline of Lake Managua. Laguna Tiscapa crater is located several kilometers to the east near the central part of the city of Managua. The elongated Nejapa and Ticoma pit craters are surrounded by small basaltic cinder cones and tuff cones. The Nejapa-Miraflores alignment (also known as Nejapa-Ticoma) has been the site of about 40 eruptions during the past 30,000 years, the most recent of which (from Asososca maar) occurred about 1250 years ago."

Momotombo began growing about 4500 years ago at the SE end of the Marrabios Range and consists of a somma from an older edifice that is surmounted by a symmetrical younger cone with a 150 x 250 m wide summit crater. Young lava flows from Momotombo have flowed down the NW flank into the 4-km-wide Monte Galán caldera. The youthful cone of Momotombito forms a 391-m-high island offshore in Lake Managua. Momotombo has a long record of strombolian eruptions, punctuated by occasional larger explosive activity. The latest eruption, in 1905, produced a lava flow that traveled from the summit to the lower NE base. A small black plume was seen above the crater after an April 10, 1996 earthquake, but later observations noted no significant changes in the crater.

"Granada","-85.980,11.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/082033.jpg","","A semi-arcuate, N-S-trending fissure located between the city of Granada and the eastern rim of Apoyo caldera was the source of the Granada alignment of small cinder cones and craters. The lineament (also known as the La Joya alignment after La Joya explosions craters SW of Granada) cuts across the flanks of Apoyo caldera only 2 km from its rim. However, the Granada alignment is structurally distinct from the caldera and is analogous to the Nejapa-Miraflores alignment north of Masaya volcano. The lineament extends from north of Granada to the northern flanks of Mombacho volcano and is characterized by the eruption of basaltic lavas and tephras compositionally similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts. A series of interconnecting collapse-explosion pits similar to those at Nejapa-Miraflores lies immediately east of the Granada cinder cone alignment. The Granada lineament originated about 12,000 years ago, and the latest eruptions may have occurred as recently as about 2000 years ago."

It lies within the massive Pleistocene Las Sierras pyroclastic shield volcano and is a broad, 6 x 11 km basaltic caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high. The caldera is filled on its NW end by more than a dozen vents that erupted along a circular, 4-km-diameter fracture system. The twin volcanoes of Nindirí and Masaya, the source of historical eruptions, were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. A major basaltic plinian tephra erupted from Masaya about 6500 years ago. Historical lava flows cover much of the caldera floor and have confined a lake to the far eastern end of the caldera. A lava flow from the 1670 eruption overtopped the north caldera rim. Masaya has been frequently active since the time of the Spanish Conquistadors, when an active lava lake prompted attempts to extract the volcano's molten 'gold.' Periods of long-term vigorous gas emission at roughly quarter-century intervals cause health hazards and crop damage."

Two large horseshoe-shaped craters formed by edifice failure cut the summit on the NE and southern flanks. The NE-flank scarp was the source of a large debris avalanche that produced an arcuate peninsula and a cluster of small islands (Las Isletas) in Lake Nicaragua. Two small, well-preserved cinder cones are located on the volcano's lower northern flank. The only reported historical activity was in 1570, when a debris avalanche destroyed a village on the south side of the volcano. Although there were contemporary reports of an explosion, there is no direct evidence that the avalanche was accompanied by an eruption. Fumarolic fields and hot springs are found within the two collapse scarps and on the upper northern flank."

A steep-walled summit crater is 250 m deep and has a higher western rim. N-S-trending fractures on the flanks of the volcano have produced chains of spatter cones, cinder cones, lava domes, and maars located on the NW, NE, SE, and southern sides extending in some cases down to Lake Nicaragua. Concepción was constructed above a basement of lake sediments, and the modern cone grew above a largely buried caldera, a small remnant of which forms a break in slope about halfway up the north flank. Frequent explosive eruptions during the past half century have increased the height of the summit significantly above that shown on current topographic maps and have kept the upper part of the volcano unvegetated."
"Esteli","-86.400,13.170","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114070.jpg","","Fresh-looking, sparsely vegetated lava flows mostly erupted from fissure vents are located in valleys in the northern interior highlands between the town of Estelí and the border with Honduras. McBirney and Williams (1965) considered basaltic flows in this area to be certainly of Quaternary, and possibly of Holocene age. The lava flows near Estelí were faulted and slightly tilted during formation of the Estelí structural basin. Other youthful basaltic lava flows, one of which was erupted from the Bonete de Carrao cone, are located between Estelí and Jinotega. Well-preserved cones are also located in the area west and south of Ocotal. Some of the youthful lava flows in northern Nicaragua contain granitic xenoliths and xenocrysts of quartz."

Five coalescing andesitic-dacitic lava domes are located in the center of the caldera, and additional domes are present on the outer flanks. Las Lajas was considered to be of Holocene age on the basis of youthful morphology (McBirney and Williams, 1965), however Plank et al. (2002) obtained three radiometric dates of Miocene age, and the main edifice may be older than previously thought. Van Wyk de Vries (1999, pers. comm.) earlier noted that Las Lajas itself was of probable Pleistocene age, but that youthful cinder cones on the flanks are similar to those of the Nejapa alignment and may be of Holocene age."

The three cones, located south of the Río Curinhuás and west of Pearl Lagoon, each have well-defined, steep-walled craters about 50-60 m across. In contrast to the circular rims of the other two cones, the rim of the easternmost cone is breached to the west. The well-defined craters and unusually low vegetation in an area of heavy rainfall and rapid weathering led Williams and McBirney (1965) to estimate that the cones were probably no more than a few thousand years old.

The highest peak of the volcanic complex is 1659-m-high Volcán Cacao, 5.5 km SE of Orosí. The summit of Cacao is cut by two large horseshoe-shaped calderas breached to the SW and east related to edifice collapse. The age of the latest activity of the complex is not known. Historical eruptions were reported from Orosí in 1844 and 1849, but even at the time of the first volcanological observations at the end of the 19th century, Orosí was overgrown with large trees, and the eruptions may actually have been from neighboring Rincón de la Vieja. The latest documented volcanic activity produced mudflows (perhaps secondary) about 3500 years ago."
"Rincon de la Vieja","-85.324,10.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096030.jpg","","Rincón de la Vieja, the largest volcano in NW Costa Rica, is a remote volcanic complex in the Guanacaste Range. The volcano consists of an elongated, arcuate NW-SE-trending ridge that was constructed within the 15-km-wide early Pleistocene Guachipelín caldera, whose rim is exposed on the south side. Sometimes known as the 'Colossus of Guanacaste,' it has an estimated volume of 130 cu km and contains at least nine major eruptive centers. Activity has migrated to the SE, where the youngest-looking craters are located. The twin cone of 1916-m-high Santa María volcano, the highest peak of the complex, is located at the eastern end of a smaller, 5-km-wide caldera and has a 500-m-wide crater. A plinian eruption producing the 0.25 cu km Río Blanca tephra about 3500 years ago was the last major magmatic eruption. All subsequent eruptions, including numerous historical eruptions possibly dating back to the 16th century, have been from the prominent crater containing a 500-m-wide acid lake (known as the Active Crater) located ENE of Von Seebach crater."
"Tenorio","-85.015,10.673","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/042035.jpg","","The 225 sq km dominantly andesitic Tenorio volcanic massif anchors the SE end of the Guanacaste Range and consists of a cluster of densely forested NNW-SSE-trending volcanic cones. Overlapping lava flows from the principal peak, Tenorio, blanket the NW-to-SW flanks and descend the NE flank. The NW-most of three craters of the central cone is sparsely vegetated and appears to be the most recently active. Volcán Montezuma to the north has twin craters, the northern of which fed a lava flow to the NE. Additional pyroclastic cones are found to the NE and SW of the central complex, and the Bijagua lava domes were constructed on the northern flank. A major debris avalanche covered about 100 sq km below the southern flank of the volcano. A legend exists of an eruption in 1816, but the volcano was densely forested at the time of an 1864 visit by Seebach and is not considered to have erupted in historical time. Fumarolic activity is present on the NE flank."
"Arenal","-84.703,10.463","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/081029.jpg","","Conical Volcán Arenal is the youngest stratovolcano in Costa Rica and one of its most active. The 1670-m-high andesitic volcano towers above the eastern shores of Lake Arenal, which has been enlarged by a hydroelectric project. Arenal lies along a volcanic chain that has migrated to the NW from the late-Pleistocene Los Perdidos lava domes through the Pleistocene-to-Holocene Chato volcano, which contains a 500-m-wide, lake-filled summit crater. The earliest known eruptions of Arenal took place about 7000 years ago, and it was active concurrently with Cerro Chato until the activity of Chato ended about 3500 years ago. Growth of Arenal has been characterized by periodic major explosive eruptions at several-hundred-year intervals and periods of lava effusion that armor the cone. An eruptive period that began with a major explosive eruption in 1968 ended in December 2010; continuous explosive activity accompanied by slow lava effusion and the occasional emission of pyroclastic flows characterized the eruption from vents at the summit and on the upper western flank."
"Platanar","-84.366,10.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/042100.jpg","","The Platanar volcanic center is the NW-most volcano in the Cordillera Central of Costa Rica. The massive complex covers about 900 sq km and is dominated by two largely Pleistocene stratovolcanoes, Platanar and Porvenir. These volcanoes were constructed within the Pleistocene Chocosuela caldera, which may have formed during a major slope failure. The 2183-m-high Cerro Platanar volcano (known locally as Volcán Congo) on the north side of the complex has prehistorical lava flows on its western flanks and is the youngest volcanic center. The highest peak of the complex is 2267-m-high Porvenir volcano, whose summit crater lies 3 km south of Platanar. A thin layer of phreatic ash suggested that an eruption from Platanar occurred within the past few thousand years (Stine and Banks, 1991). The Aguas Zarcas group of nine basaltic cinder cones, located on the north flank of the Platanar-Porvenir complex to as low as 160 m altitude, is in part Holocene in age."

The caldera was formed during several major explosive eruptions that produced voluminous dacitic-rhyolitic pyroclastic flows between about 1.5 and 0.6 million years ago. Growth of post-caldera volcanoes in the eastern part of the caldera that overtopped much of the eastern and southern caldera rims was interrupted by edifice collapse that produced a major debris avalanche to the SW. Morphologically youthful lava flows cover the western and SW flanks of the post-caldera Miravalles complex, which rises above the town of Guayabo on the flat western caldera floor. The only reported historical eruptive activity was a small steam explosion on the SW flank in 1946. High heat flow remains, and Miravalles is the site of the largest developed geothermal field in Costa Rica."

The frequently visited multi-hued summit crater lakes of the basaltic-to-dacitic volcano, which is one of Costa Rica's most prominent natural landmarks, are easily accessible by vehicle from the nearby capital city of San José. A N-S-trending fissure cutting the 2708-m-high complex stratovolcano extends to the lower northern flank, where it has produced the Congo stratovolcano and several lake-filled maars. The southernmost of the two summit crater lakes, Botos, is cold and clear and last erupted about 7500 years ago. The more prominent geothermally heated northern lake, Laguna Caliente, is one of the world's most acidic natural lakes, with a pH of near zero. It has been the site of frequent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions since the first historical eruption was reported in 1828. Eruptions often include geyser-like ejections of crater-lake water."

Its three principal summits visible from the Central Valley give it the common local name of Las Tres Marías. The voluminous andesitic-to-dacitic Tiribí Tuff, exposed in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, was erupted about 322,000 years ago from the Barva summit caldera. Four pyroclastic cones are constructed within the 2 x 3 km caldera at the central and NW part of the summit. The SW peak contains four cones, one of which has a crater lake. Satellitic cones are found on the northern and southern flanks. Lava flows blanket the south side of Barva volcano. The Los Angeles flow, one of the most recent, descends nearly to the city of Heredia. A large plinian eruption occurred at Barva during the early Holocene. Eruptions were reported in 1760 or 1766, 1776? (also a mudflow), and 1867, but later visits to the summit did not provide evidence of eruptions during historical time."

At least 10 satellitic cones are located on the southern flank of Irazú. No lava flows have been identified from Irazú since the eruption of the massive Cervantes lava flows from south-flank vents about 14,000 years ago, and all known Holocene eruptions have been explosive. The focus of eruptions at the summit crater complex has migrated to the west towards the historically active crater, which contains a small lake of variable size and color. Although eruptions may have occurred around the time of the Spanish conquest, the first well-documented historical eruption occurred in 1723, and frequent explosive eruptions have occurred since.

The forested 3474-m-high volcano (also referred to as Volcán de Chiriqui) is the highest peak in Panamá, and the summit now bristles with communication towers. A large 6-km-wide summit caldera breached widely to the west was formed by a large volcanic landslide, which created a massive debris-avalanche deposit about 9000 years ago that extends onto the Pacific coastal plain, largely overlying deposits of an earlier late-Pleistocene debris avalanche. Post-collapse eruptions have constructed lava domes inside the caldera that have grown to a height exceeding that of the caldera rim. A strong explosive eruption at about 700 CE ended human occupation at the Cerro Punta archaeological site NW of the volcano. Montessus de Ballore (1884) reported a strong eruption at Barú in the mid-16th century. Sapper (1917) considered this report to be uncertain, but radiocarbon dates subsequently imply tephra deposits younger than about 500 years.

The 6-km-wide El Valle de Antón caldera was formed about 56,000 years ago in association with eruption of the dacitic El Hato pyroclastic flows. The caldera has steep, 200-300 m high walls overlooking a flat floor underlain by deposits of a former caldera lake and currently occupied by the town of El Valle. Cerro Pajita, Cerro Gaital, and Cerro Caracoral form a dacitic lava dome complex that was constructed along an E-W-trending lineament within the caldera and forms the 1185 m high point of the volcano. Major phreatomagmatic plinian eruptions produced when magma interacted with caldera-lake water as recently as about 34,600 years ago generated pyroclastic flows that reached the Pacific coast, 25 km S. Phreatic eruptions have occurred since then (the most recent dated eruption took place about 13,000 years ago), and activity may have continued into the Holocene (IRHE, 1987).

The latest eruptions took place from the northern part of the horst about 220,000 years ago at Cerro Corero lava dome (also known as Cerro de la Charca), north of El Castillo. The youngest feature of the La Yeguada complex is the Media Luna cinder cone, which was erupted through Tertiary ignimbrite deposits at the NW side of the complex. The oldest peat layer within a small lake dammed by a basaltic lava flow originating from the cone was radiocarbon dated at about 300-350 years ago, but later dating has shown that flow was erupted about 45,000 years ago, and that the La Yeguada complex has not had Holocene eruptions.

"Mojanda","-78.270,0.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116100.jpg","","Mojanda, one of the largest volcanoes of Ecuador's northern Interandean Depression, rises SW of the historic town of Otavalo. Volcán Mojanda has a complex geologic history involving two adjacent simultaneously active volcanoes. An earlier edifice contains remnants of a larger earlier caldera and a smaller summit caldera occupied by two lakes. The andesitic-to-rhyolitic Fuya Fuya volcano was constructed contemporaneously immediately to the west of Mojanda and produced two major rhyolitic plinian explosive eruptions, possibly associated with caldera formation. Fuya Fuya underwent edifice collapse less than 165,000 years ago, leaving a large horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the west. Subsequently, a new composite cone and dacitic lava domes were extruded inside the caldera. The youngest domes are unglaciated and of possible Holocene age."
"Cayambe","-77.986,0.029","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044006.jpg","","The massive compound andesitic-dacitic Cayambe stratovolcano is located on the isolated western edge of the Cordillera Real, east of the Inter-Andean Valley. The 5790-m-high volcano, whose southern flank lies astride the equator, is capped by extensive glaciers, which descend to 4200 m on the eastern Amazonian side. The modern Nevado Cayambe volcano, constructed to the east of older Pleistocene volcanic complexes, contains two summit lava domes located about 1.5 km apart, the western of which is the highest. Several other lava domes on the upper flanks have been the source of pyroclastic flows that reached the lower flanks of the volcano. A prominent Holocene pyroclastic cone on the lower eastern flank, La Virgen, fed thick andesitic lava flows that traveled about 10 km to the east. Nevado Cayambe was recently discovered to have produced frequent explosive eruptions during the Holocene beginning about 4000 years ago, and to have had a single historical eruption, during 1785-86."
"Pululagua","-78.463,0.038","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044018.jpg","","Pululagua is a relatively low, forested volcano immediately north of the equator, about 15 km north of Quito. The volcano contains a 5-km-wide summit caldera narrowly breached to the west and partially filled by a group of dacitic lava domes. Older pre-caldera lava domes are found on the eastern, SE, and southern sides of the caldera, with a group of younger pre-caldera lava domes primarily on the eastern side. Four post-caldera domes rises up to 480 m above the caldera floor. Large explosive eruptions producing pyroclastic flows took place during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Caldera formation took place during a series of eruptions lasting 150-200 years beginning about 2650 radiocarbon years ago. The latest dated eruption occurred from post-caldera lava domes about 1670 years ago and produced lava flows and pyroclastic flows."

The forested, dominantly andesitic Volcán El Reventador stratovolcano rises to 3562 m above the jungles of the western Amazon basin. A 4-km-wide caldera widely breached to the east was formed by edifice collapse and is partially filled by a young, unvegetated stratovolcano that rises about 1300 m above the caldera floor to a height comparable to the caldera rim. It has been the source of numerous lava flows as well as explosive eruptions that were visible from Quito in historical time. Frequent lahars in this region of heavy rainfall have constructed a debris plain on the eastern floor of the caldera. The largest historical eruption took place in 2002, producing a 17-km-high eruption column, pyroclastic flows that traveled up to 8 km, and lava flows from summit and flank vents."
"Atacazo","-78.617,-0.353","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044032.jpg","","Atacazo stratovolcano, located about 25 km SW of the capital city of Quito, consists of a large Pleistocene andesitic stratovolcanoes truncated by a late-Pleistocene to Holocene caldera. Growth of La Carcacha stratovolcano was followed by construction of Atacazo, a stratovolcano with flank lava domes. The 6-km-wide caldera, which is breached to the SW, is partially filled by three dacitic lava-dome complexes of Holocene age. Two andesitic lava domes are also found on the SE flank. Several plinian eruptions have occurred at the Atacazo-Ninahuilca complex during the Holocene, accompanied by growth of lava domes. The latest dated eruption took place about 2300 years ago, forming the Ninahuilca Chico lava domes within the summit caldera. Dome formation was accompanied by plinian explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows that traveled 35 km down valleys to the west."
"Chacana","-78.250,-0.375","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044035.jpg","","Chacana is a massive, eroded caldera complex of Pliocene-Holocene age that forms one of the largest rhyolitic centers of the northern Andes. The caldera is 32-km long in the N-S direction and 18-24 km wide in the E-W direction. Chacana was constructed during three cycles of andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcanism, with major eruptions about 240,000, 180,00, and 160,000 years ago. Dacitic lava flows were erupted from caldera-floor fissures between about 30,000 and 21,000 years ago. Numerous lava domes were constructed within the caldera, which has been the source of frequent explosive eruptions throughout the Holocene as well as historical lava flows during the 18th century. The massive Antisana stratovolcano was constructed immediately to the SE."
"Guagua Pichincha","-78.598,-0.171","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116065.jpg","","Guagua Pichincha and the older Pleistocene Rucu Pichincha stratovolcanoes form a broad volcanic massif that rises immediately to the west of Ecuador's capital city, Quito. A lava dome is located at the head of a 6-km-wide breached caldera that formed during a late-Pleistocene slope failure of Guagua Pichincha about 50,000 years ago. Subsequent late-Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions from the central vent in the breached caldera consisted of explosive activity with pyroclastic flows accompanied by periodic growth and destruction of the central lava dome. Many minor eruptions have occurred since the beginning of the Spanish era at Guagua Pichincha, which is one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes. The largest historical eruption took place in 1660, when ash fell over a 1000 km radius, accumulating to 30 cm depth in Quito. Pyroclastic flows and surges also occurred, primarily to the west, and affected agricultural activity, causing great economic losses."
"Aliso","-78.000,-0.530","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114089.jpg","","The newly discovered Aliso volcanic complex lies at the eastern foot of the Ecuadorian Andes, east of Antisana volcano and SW of the town of Baeza. The largely unexplored complex contains an arcuate summit ridge on the west with older andesitic lava flows and tundra-like vegetation, and rhyolitic and dacitic lava domes in a wet cloud-forest environment on the lower eastern flanks. The Pumayacu center on the SE flank contains several lava domes along a NNE axis parallel to the Andean Thrust Fault System (TFZ). Morphologically young andesitic lava flows occur along the flat-topped ridge above Baeza town. The Pumayacu center erupted pyroclastic-flow deposits of late Pleistocene and Holocene age. One pyroclastic-flow deposit was dated at about 4400 years Before Present, and a pumice lapilli layer overlies a ceramic-rich cultural horizon thought to be about 2000 years old."
"Antisana","-78.141,-0.481","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044037.jpg","","Antisana is a massive, glacier-covered stratovolcano NE of Cotopaxi, along the western margin of the Cordillera Real, 50 km SE of Quito. An older edifice forming the east side of the volcano was constructed over granitic and metasedimentary rocks and is itself overtopped on its NW side by the modern edifice. Two small calderas, one breached to the south and the other to the NE, truncate the older edifice. Viscous, youthful block lava flows have issued from radial fissures on the flanks of 5753-m-high Antisana, one of the highest peaks in Ecuador. The only unequivocal historical eruption took place from 1801 to 1802, when a lava flow was erupted from a vent NNE of the summit. Eighteenth-century eruptions occurred SW of Antisana, in the Chacana caldera."
"Illiniza","-78.714,-0.659","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044040.jpg","","The twin glacier-covered peaks of Iliniza volcano form prominent landmarks west of the Interandean valley. Iliniza Norte lies 1.8 km NNW of the higher peak, 5248-m Iliniza Sur. The dominantly andesitic-to-dacitic Iliniza is largely, if not entirely Pleistocene in age. However, the Tishigcuchi (Rasuyacu) lava dome on the south flank was active during the Holocene. Recent work suggests that Iliniza itself, which is substantially eroded, may have had relatively young eruptions (Hall 1987, pers. comm.). Iliniza Norte is a remnant of the main volcanic edifice, and the younger Iliniza Sur is an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano surrounded by thick pyroclastic-flow deposits. An explosive eruption formed a small caldera, which is partially filled by a lava dome forming the summit of Iliniza Sur. Two lava domes are found on the southern and NE flanks of the complex."
"Sumaco","-77.626,-0.538","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112100.jpg","","The forested Sumaco stratovolcano rises 2800 m above the jungles of the western Amazon basin, east of Antisana volcano, and occupies an isolated position far to the east of the main Andes volcanic axis. Constructed over Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, 3990-m-high Sumaco forms a relatively symmetrical cone in an area of heavy rainfall and erosion. Sumaco has produced alkaline tephritic, basanitic, and phonolitic rocks distinct from those of the main Andean chain. The volcano has a broad summit crater, 300 x 400 m wide, containing a central cone. Reports of historical eruptions are somewhat ambiguous; an eruption is inferred in the 18th or early-19th century on the basis of changes in crater morphology."
"Cotopaxi","-78.436,-0.677","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044050.jpg","","Symmetrical, glacier-clad Cotopaxi stratovolcano is Ecuador's most well-known volcano and one of its most active. The steep-sided cone is capped by nested summit craters, the largest of which is about 550 x 800 m in diameter. Deep valleys scoured by lahars radiate from the summit of the andesitic volcano, and large andesitic lava flows extend as far as the base of Cotopaxi. The modern conical volcano has been constructed since a major edifice collapse sometime prior to about 5000 years ago. Pyroclastic flows (often confused in historical accounts with lava flows) have accompanied many explosive eruptions of Cotopaxi, and lahars have frequently devastated adjacent valleys. The most violent historical eruptions took place in 1744, 1768, and 1877. Pyroclastic flows descended all sides of the volcano in 1877, and lahars traveled more than 100 km into the Pacific Ocean and western Amazon basin. The last significant eruption of Cotopaxi took place in 1904."
"Quilotoa","-78.900,-0.850","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044076.jpg","","Quilotoa is a truncated, dacitic cone that is the westernmost of Ecuador's Andean volcanoes. It is located at the margin of the Western Cordillera, 35 km WNW of the city of Latacunga and contains a 3-km-wide caldera with steep-sided walls that rise 400 m above the surface of 240-m-deep caldera lake. More than a half dozen lava domes form an circular array along the caldera's perimeter. This small volcano has produced eight major explosive eruptions during the past 200,000 years. Its most recent major eruption about 800 radiocarbon years ago produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, lahars that reached the Pacific Ocean, and one of the largest airfall-tephra deposits of the northern Andes. Formation of the caldera was followed by extrusion of a small lava dome. Reports of historical eruptions from the caldera lake are somewhat ambiguous. Fumaroles are present on the lake floor and hot springs occur on the eastern flank."
"Chimborazo","-78.815,-1.464","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116041.jpg","","Glacier-clad, 6310-m-high Chimborazo, Ecuador's highest volcano, anchors the southern end of the country's 'Avenue of Volcanoes' 30 km NW of the city of Riobamba. The dominantly andesitic-to-dacitic Chimborazo volcano is mostly of Pliocene-to-Pleistocene age. The volcano collapsed about 35,000 years ago, producing a major debris avalanche, whose deposits underlie Riobamba and temporarily dammed the Río Chambo, producing an ephemeral lake. Subsequent eruptions have been dominantly andesitic and constructed three edifices along an east-west line, the youngest and westernmost of which forms the current summit of Chimborazo. Although activity was at one time thought to have ceased during the very latest Pleistocene, recent work indicates that Chimborazo erupted more than a half dozen times during the Holocene, producing pyroclastic surges that reached down to 3800 m elevation."

These three basaltic-andesite to andesitic cones form the southernmost area of Quaternary volcanism in the Interandean valley of Ecuador. The basaltic-andesite Cerro Tulabug at 3336 m is the highest of the cones and rises 3 km NW of the town of Licto. Loma Bellavista, 2 km NE of the town, is a 3113-m-high andesitic scoria cone. A third cone, Licto, is of basaltic-andesite composition. The Licto group was considered to be of late-Pleistocene or Holocene age (Hall, 1987, pers. comm; Eissen, 2006, pers. comm.) based on the relatively youthful morphology of the cones."

Three major edifices have been sequentially constructed since the mid-Pleistocene over a basement of metamorphic rocks. Tungurahua II was built within the past 14,000 years following the collapse of the initial edifice. Tungurahua II itself collapsed about 3000 years ago and produced a large debris-avalanche deposit and a horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the west, inside which the modern glacier-capped stratovolcano (Tungurahua III) was constructed. Historical eruptions have all originated from the summit crater, accompanied by strong explosions and sometimes by pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached populated areas at the volcano's base. Prior to a long-term eruption beginning in 1999 that caused the temporary evacuation of the city of Baños at the foot of the volcano, the last major eruption had occurred from 1916 to 1918, although minor activity continued until 1925."
"Sangay","-78.341,-2.005","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/044090.jpg","","The isolated Sangay volcano, located east of the Andean crest, is the southernmost of Ecuador's volcanoes, and its most active. The dominantly andesitic volcano has been in frequent eruption for the past several centuries. The steep-sided, 5230-m-high glacier-covered volcano grew within horseshoe-shaped calderas of two previous edifices, which were destroyed by collapse to the east, producing large debris avalanches that reached the Amazonian lowlands. The modern edifice dates back to at least 14,000 years ago. It towers above the tropical jungle on the east side; on the other sides flat plains of ash have been sculpted by heavy rains into steep-walled canyons up to 600 m deep. The earliest report of a historical eruption was in 1628. More or less continuous eruptions were reported from 1728 until 1916, and again from 1934 to the present. The almost constant activity has caused frequent changes to the morphology of the summit crater complex."
"Ecuador","-91.546,-0.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116052.jpg","","Volcán Ecuador straddles the equator at the NW end of Isabela Island. The western side of the volcano, the smallest of the six large shield volcanoes on Isabela, is broadly breached by edifice collapse, and youthful lava flows cover much of the caldera floor. Two large pyroclastic cones were constructed along the coast, and several chains of spatter cones and small scoria cones cross the caldera floor, which has a prominent bench on its southern side. A single dark-colored aa lava flow covers about half of the caldera floor. A number of young lava flows reach the coast to form Cape Berkeley, west of a large youthful-looking tuff cone. Extending from the outer eastern flanks of the main edifice is a line of NE-trending fissure-fed vents that connect Volcán Ecuador (also known as Cape Berkeley volcano) with Volcán Wolf. Volcán Ecuador is the only Isabela Island volcano without historical eruptions. However, the youthful morphology of its most recent lava flows resembles those of very recent flows on other Isabela Island volcanoes."
"Fernandina","-91.550,-0.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/062078.jpg","","Fernandina, the most active of Galápagos volcanoes and the one closest to the Galápagos mantle plume, is a basaltic shield volcano with a deep 5 x 6.5 km summit caldera. The volcano displays the classic 'overturned soup bowl' profile of Galápagos shield volcanoes. Its caldera is elongated in a NW-SE direction and formed during several episodes of collapse. Circumferential fissures surround the caldera and were instrumental in growth of the volcano. Reporting has been poor in this uninhabited western end of the archipelago, and even a 1981 eruption was not witnessed at the time. In 1968 the caldera floor dropped 350 m following a major explosive eruption. Subsequent eruptions, mostly from vents located on or near the caldera boundary faults, have produced lava flows inside the caldera as well as those in 1995 that reached the coast from a SW-flank vent. Collapse of a nearly 1 cu km section of the east caldera wall during an eruption in 1988 produced a debris-avalanche deposit that covered much of the caldera floor and absorbed the caldera lake."
"Wolf","-91.350,0.020","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047027.jpg","","Wolf, the highest volcano of the Galápagos Islands, straddles the equator at the north end of the archipelago's largest island, Isabela. The 1710-m-high edifice has steeper slopes than most other Isabela volcanoes, reaching angles up to 35 degrees. A 6 x 7 km caldera, at 700 m one of the deepest of the Galápagos Islands, is located at the summit. A prominent bench on the west side of the caldera rises 450 above the caldera floor, much of which is covered by a lava flow erupted in 1982. Radial fissures concentrated along diffuse rift zones extend down the north, NW, and SE flanks, and submarine vents lie beyond the north and NW fissures. Similar unvegetated flows originating from a circumferential chain of spatter and scoria cones on the eastern caldera rim drape the forested flanks to the sea. The proportion of aa lava flows at Volcán Wolf exceeds that of other Galápagos volcanoes. An eruption in in 1797 was the first documented historical eruption in the Galápagos Islands."
"Darwin","-91.280,-0.180","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047030.jpg","","Volcán Darwin, named after the renowned naturalist, contains a symmetrical 5-km-wide, 200-m-deep summit caldera whose floor is nearly covered by youthful lava flows. A broad terrace occupies the SW part of the caldera. Fresh-looking, unvegetated lava flows descend all flanks and reach both the eastern and western coasts. The most recent summit activity produced several small lava flows from vents on the east caldera floor and NE and SE caldera rims. Radial fissures descend the flanks, and one reaches beyond its base to the the SW coast and cuts Tagus tuff cone. The sheltered anchorage of Tagus Cove breaches the southern side of the cone and was visited by Darwin and other noted visitors. This prominent tuff cone and its neighbor Beagle (also breached to the south) are located on the SW-flank coastline and were a prominent part of Darwin's geological studies in the Galápagos Islands."
"Alcedo","-91.120,-0.430","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047037.jpg","","Alcedo is one of the lowest and smallest of six shield volcanoes on Isabela Island. Much of the flanks and summit caldera are vegetated, but young lava flows are prominent on the northern flank near the saddle with Darwin volcano. Alcedo is the only Galápagos volcano known to have erupted rhyolite as well as basalt, producing about 1 cu km of late-Pleistocene rhyolitic tephra and lava flows from several vents late in its history. Recent faulting has produced a moat around part of the 7-8 km caldera floor, which is elongated N-S and appears to be migrating to the south. Fewer circumferential fissures occur on Alcedo than on other western Galápagos volcanoes. An eruption attributed to Alcedo in 1954 (Richards, 1957) is more likely to have been from neighboring Sierra Negra (Simkin 1980, pers. comm.). Photo-geologic mapping of Alcedo by K. A. Howard (pers. comm.) revealed only one flow on October 30, 1960 photographs that does not appear on May 30, 1946 photos. That is near Cartago Bay, low on the SE flank, rather than the 610-m, NE-flank elevation listed for the 1954 eruption. An active hydrothermal system is located within the caldera."
"Negra, Sierra","-91.170,-0.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/116056.jpg","","The broad shield volcano of Sierra Negra at the southern end of Isabela Island contains a shallow 7 x 10.5 km caldera that is the largest in the Galápagos Islands. Flank vents abound, including cinder cones and spatter cones concentrated along an ENE-trending rift system and tuff cones along the coast and forming offshore islands. The 1124-m-high volcano is elongated in a NE direction. Although it is the largest of the five major Isabela volcanoes, it has the flattest slopes, averaging less than 5 degrees and diminishing to 2 degrees near the coast. A sinuous 14-km-long, N-S-trending ridge occupies the west part of the caldera floor, which lies only about 100 m below its rim. Volcán de Azufre, the largest fumarolic area in the Galápagos Islands, lies within a graben between this ridge and the west caldera wall. Lava flows from a major eruption in 1979 extend all the way to the north coast from circumferential fissure vents on the upper northern flank. Sierra Negra, along with Cerro Azul and Volcán Wolf, is one of the most active of Isabela Island volcanoes."
"Azul, Cerro","-91.408,-0.920","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/092042.jpg","","Located at the SW tip of the J-shaped Isabela Island, Cerro Azul contains a steep-walled 4 x 5 km nested summit caldera complex that is one of the smallest diameter, but at 650 m one of the deepest in the Galápagos Islands. The 1640-m-high shield volcano is the second highest of the archipelago. A conspicuous bench occupies the SW and west sides of the caldera, which formed during several episodes of collapse. Youthful lava flows cover much of the caldera floor, which has also contained ephemeral lakes. A prominent tuff cone located at the ENE side of the caldera is evidence of episodic hydrovolcanism. Numerous spatter cones dot the western flanks. Fresh-looking lava flows, many erupted from circumferential fissures, descend the NE and NW flanks. Historical eruptions date back only to 1932, but Cerro Azul has been one of the most active Galápagos volcanoes since that time. Solfataric activity continues within the caldera."
"Pinta","-90.750,0.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/087027.jpg","","The elongated island of Pinta is the northernmost of the active Galápagos volcanoes. Pinta is a shield volcano with numerous young cones and lava flows originating from NNW-trending fissures. A steep sea cliff truncates the western side of the volcano, which lacks the prominent summit caldera of Fernandina and Isabela Island volcanoes. The fresh, unvegetated lava flows that cover the SE and northern flanks appear to have been erupted during the past few thousand or few hundred years (McBirney and Williams 1969). An eruption of uncertain nature was reported in 1928 (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World)."
"Genovesa","-89.958,0.320","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110032.jpg","","The small, very low island of Genovesa is the top of a shield volcano, whose summit is only 64 m high. The surface of a summit crater lake is near sea level. A larger, 2-km-wide excentric caldera on the south side forms an embayment that is filled by Darwin Bay. Sediment filling Arctulus Lake, a crater in the center of the island, is less than 6000 years old. Youthful flows erupted from flank fissures cover much of the island and very fresh, glassy spatter is found on the volcano's flank (Simkin 1976, pers. comm.). No historical eruptions are known from Genovesa, although the fresh-looking lava flows suggest a very youthful age. Basaltic rocks on the island are noted for their abundant coarse plagioclases."
"Marchena","-90.470,0.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101080.jpg","","The low shield volcano forming Marchena Island contains one of the largest calderas of the Galápagos Islands. In contrast to other Galápagos volcanoes, the 6 x 7 km caldera and its outer flanks have been largely buried by a cluster of pyroclastic cones and associated lava flows. Its first historical eruption occurred in 1991. Other young lava flows, some of which may be only a few thousand, or even a few hundred years old, filled the caldera and flowed down its outer forested flanks, in some cases to the sea."

Older uplifted submarine lava flows are found on the NE part of the island and at the fault-delimited offshore island of Baltra. The highland scoria cones are grouped along an E-W belt parallel to recent fault scarps that border Academy Bay. The youngest lava flows were erupted from vents along the summit fissure and on the northern flank. Their fresh morphology and sparsely vegetated surfaces suggest they may be only a few thousand years old, although their ages are not known precisely."
"Santiago","-90.770,-0.220","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047049.jpg","","The elongated shield volcano of Santiago Island, also known as San Salvador Island or James Island, is dotted with Holocene pyroclastic cones. Fresh-looking lava flows from these cones blanket the flanks of the volcano. The 920-m-high summit ridge, lined with a chain of NW-trending cinder and spatter cones, is located at the NW end of the island. Prominent flank tuff cones occur at the western and eastern coasts of Santiago. The most recent activity at Santiago has been concentrated at the NW and SE ends of the island. The spectacular pahoehoe lava flows at James and Sullivan Bays, on opposite ends of the island, were erupted during historical time. The James Bay flows were dated by fragments of marmalade pots left by buccaneers in 1684 that were subsequently embedded in the lava flows described by Charles Darwin in 1835."

The SW-side shield volcano morphologically resembles low-angle Hawaiian shields more than the steep-sided shields of Fernandina and Isabela Island. Most lava flows on the NE part of the island originated from SW-NE-trending fissures. Young lava flows have reached the sea, where some littoral cones formed. The latest eruptions were prehistorical in age, but are probably less than 1000 years old. Kicker Rock, two paired, steep-cliffed islands separated by a narrow cleft, is an enroded remnant of a tuff cone that forms one of the scenic highlights of the Galápagos, 5 km off the west coast of San Cristóbal."

The Cerro Auquihuato cinder cone was constructed along the southern rim of the plateau and fed a pristine lava flow with very prominent levees that traveled southward down a river valley dissecting the margins of the plateau."
"Sara Sara","-73.450,-15.330","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117038.jpg","","Glacier-covered Sara Sara volcano lying between Laguna Parinacocha and the Río Ocona is the westernmost young volcano in Perú. The 5522-m-high andesitic stratovolcano was the source of youthful-looking lava flows with prominent levees that traveled about 10 km eastward into the Río Ocona valley. Pristine lava flows on the upper slopes of the volcano and ash layers in peat deposits at its base suggest a very young, probably Holocene age."
"Coropuna","-72.650,-15.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047060.jpg","","Nevado Coropuna, Peru's highest and largest volcano, is a massive ice-covered volcanic complex with at least a half dozen summit cones scattered over a 12 x 20 km area. The 6377-m-high summit of the andesitic-to-dacitic complex is a cone at the NW end, north of a line of E-W-trending cones. Deep, steep-walled canyons surrounding the volcano give it an impressive topographic relief of more than 4000 m over a horizontal distance of 15 km. Several young Holocene lava flows descend the NE, SE, and western flanks. The age of its latest eruption is not known, but solfataric activity has been reported."
"Andahua-Orcopampa","-72.330,-15.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047063.jpg","","The Andahua-Orcopampa volcanic field in the Andahua valley area, 20 km ENE of Nevados de Coropuna, is a large 60 x 60 km scoria cone and lava field. Known locally as the 'Valley of the Volcanoes,' the volcanic field lies in a series of deep NNW-SSE-trending, en-echelon valleys: Orcopampa, Andahua, and Ayo. The volcanic field contains extremely youthful dominantly trachyandesitic cinder cones and lava flows that have destroyed buildings and may be only a few hundred years old. The area was reported to have been active during the time of the Incas and to have 'become active again' in 1913. Lava flows have repeatedly dammed the Río Andagua valley, and an existing small lake was impounded by the youngest lavas."
"Huambo","-72.130,-15.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118092.jpg","","The monogenetic Huambo volcanic field lies SSE of the Andahua-Orcocampo volcanic field, west of Sabancaya volcano. The Huambo volcanic field is divided into two segments. The southern area contains several cinder cones and associated lava flows, some of which are inferred to be of early to late-Holocene age on the basis of morphological criteria. The northern part contains a single vent, the Cerro Keyocc cinder cone, which produced an extensive lava field that blanketed a plateau to the west during an eruption radiocarbon dated at about 2650 years ago."
"Sabancaya","-71.850,-15.780","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047068.jpg","","Sabancaya, located on the saddle between 6288-m-high Ampato and 6025-m-high Hualca Hualca volcanoes, is the youngest of these volcanic centers and the only one to have erupted in historical time. The oldest of the three volcanoes, Nevado Hualca Hualca, is of probable late-Pliocene to early Pleistocene age. Both Nevado Ampato and Nevado Sabancaya are only slightly affected by glacial erosion and consist of a series of lava domes aligned along a NW-SW trend. The name of 5967-m-high Sabancaya (meaning 'tongue of fire' in the Quechua Indian language) first appeared in records in 1595 CE, suggesting activity prior to that date. Holocene activity has consisted of plinian eruptions followed by emission of voluminous andesitic and dacitic lava flows, which form an extensive apron around the volcano on all sides but the south. Records of historical eruptions date back to 1750."
"Chachani, Nevado","-71.530,-16.191","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047085.jpg","","The andesitic-dacitic Nevado de Chachani volcanic complex, located immediately north of Arequipa, consists of a 320 sq km group of Pleistocene lava domes, a stratovolcano complex, and a flank shield volcano. The central, 6057-m-high Nevado Chachani complex contains multiple vents along an arcuate line, including a well-defined summit crater at the western end. Two early Pleistocene ignimbrites were erupted from now-buried vents of older edifices. Thin lava flows from Chachani volcano overlie glacial moraines. Pleistocene lava domes form the northern end of the complex. The 8-km-wide, late Pleistocene to possibly Holocene lava shield of Pampa de Palacio on the SW side produced a well-preserved lava flow field that represents the youngest products of the Nevado Chachani complex."
"Nicholson, Cerro","-71.754,-16.261","Cerro Nicholson, a small isolated scoria cone, was constructed on a plain WSW of Chachani volcano and WNW of El Misti volcano. Andesitic bombs surround the crater of this relatively young volcanic feature that displays a well-preserved crater at the summit of the scoria cone and has a morphology similar to the Holocene Andahua scoria cones farther to the north. Cerro Nicholson was erupted through a 1.65-million-year-old Arequipa Airport Ignimbrite deposit erupted from a now-buried site beneath the Chachani volcanic complex."
"Misti, El","-71.409,-16.294","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047087.jpg","","El Misti, Peru's most well-known volcano, is a symmetrical andesitic stratovolcano with nested summit craters that towers above the city of Arequipa. The modern symmetrical cone, constructed within a small 1.5 x 2 km wide summit caldera that formed between about 13,700 and 11,300 years ago, caps older Pleistocene volcanoes that underwent caldera collapse about 50,000 years ago. A large scoria cone has grown with the 830-m-wide outer summit crater of El Misti. At least 20 tephra-fall deposits and numerous pyroclastic-flow deposits have been documented during the past 50,000 years, including a pyroclastic flow that traveled 12 km to the south about 2000 years ago. El Misti's most recent activity has been dominantly pyroclastic, and strong winds have formed a parabolic dune field of volcanic ash extending up to 20 km downwind. An eruption in the 15th century affected Inca inhabitants living near the volcano. Some reports of historical eruptions may represent increased fumarolic activity."
"Ubinas","-70.903,-16.355","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/047092.jpg","","A small, 1.4-km-wide caldera cuts the top of Ubinas, Peru's most active volcano, giving it a truncated appearance. It is the northernmost of three young volcanoes located along a regional structural lineament about 50 km behind the main volcanic front of Perú. The growth and destruction of Ubinas I was followed by construction of Ubinas II beginning in the mid-Pleistocene. The upper slopes of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic Ubinas II stratovolcano are composed primarily of andesitic and trachyandesitic lava flows and steepen to nearly 45 degrees. The steep-walled, 150-m-deep summit caldera contains an ash cone with a 500-m-wide funnel-shaped vent that is 200 m deep. Debris-avalanche deposits from the collapse of the SE flank about 3700 years ago extend 10 km from the volcano. Widespread plinian pumice-fall deposits include one of Holocene age about 1000 years ago. Holocene lava flows are visible on the flanks, but historical activity, documented since the 16th century, has consisted of intermittent minor-to-moderate explosive eruptions."
"Ticsani","-70.595,-16.755","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114099.jpg","","Ticsani is a 5408-m-high dacitic lava dome complex in the Ichuna district across the Río Tambo about 30 km SE of Huaynaputina volcano. Volcán Ticsani resembles Huaynaputina in its dacitic composition and explosive eruptive style. Both volcanoes lie about 50 km behind the main volcanic front of the Peruvian Andes. A fresh-looking lava field lies at the NW base of the youthful-looking, unglaciated volcano. A major debris avalanche produced by collapse of the volcano partially filled the Río Tambor to the south. Emplacement of three lava domes since the end of the Pleistocene was accompanied by explosive eruptions. No historical eruptions are known, but fumarolic activity continues, and pumice from the crater containing the youngest lava dome overlies tephra from the 1600 CE Huaynaputina eruption."
"Huaynaputina","-70.850,-16.608","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068068.jpg","","Huaynaputina (whose name means 'new volcano') is a relatively inconspicuous volcano that was the source of the largest historical eruption of South America in 1600 CE. The volcano has no prominent topographic expression and lies within a 2.5-km-wide depression formed by edifice collapse and further excavated by glaciers within an older edifice of Tertiary-to-Pleistocene age. Three overlapping ash cones with craters up to 100 m deep were constructed during the 1600 CE eruption on the floor of the ancestral crater, whose outer flanks are heavily mantled by ash deposits from the 1600 eruption. This powerful fissure-fed eruption may have produced nearly 30 cu km of dacitic tephra, including pyroclastic flows and surges that traveled 13 km to the east and SE. Lahars reached the Pacific Ocean, 120 km away. The eruption caused substantial damage to the major cities of Arequipa and Moquengua, and regional economies took 150 years to fully recover."
"Tutupaca","-70.372,-17.026","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114098.jpg","","Tutupaca consists of two dissected volcanic edifices, of which the southern appears more youthful. Collapse of the northern edifice produced a debris avalanche that traveled 7 km N. Postglacial lava flows are present, the largest of which originated from the saddle between the two edifices. Solfataric activity was noted in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World. Based on morphological evidence, de Silva and Francis (1990) suggested that reported historical eruptions in the 18th and 19th centuries (listed in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) more likely originated from the more youthful-looking Yucamane volcano. Work by Samaniego et al. (2015) showed that activity in 1787-89 and 1802 CE originated at Tutupaca, and they considered the 1780, 1862, and 1902 reports to be valid as well."
"Yucamane","-70.196,-17.184","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114096.jpg","","Volcán Yucamane lies at the south end of a group of three volcanoes known as the Caliente-Yucamane Volcanic Complex; both it and Cerro Caliente to the north display evidence of postglacial lava flows, which overlie thick moraines. The andesitic Yucamane has a youthful, well-preserved summit crater. Late-Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions have produced airfall deposits, pyroclastic flows and surges, and block-and-ash flows produced by growth and collapse of lava domes. The most recent confirmed eruption, a subplinian event, took place about 3000-3300 radiocarbon years ago. Historical eruptions originally attributed to the more dissected Tutupaca during the 18th-20th centuries (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) were considered by de Silva and Francis (1990) to have more likely been from Yucamane, but later authors (eg. Samaniego et al. 2015) assigned them to Tutupaca, including an eruption of uncertain character reported in 1787 (Volcanological Society of Japan, 1971). Ongoing fieldwork has not found deposits younger than the 3000 BP event (Samaniego, 2015)."
"Casiri, Nevados","-69.813,-17.470","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114097.jpg","","The Nevados Casiri complex, the southernmost Holocene volcano in Perú, lies near the Chilean border, about 25 km north of Tacora volcano. Nevados Casiri consists of four volcanic edifices, with the youngest cone on the SE side. This compound trachytic and trachyandesitic volcano reaches an elevation of 5650 m and is also known as Paugarani. Two fresh Holocene lava flows are located south of the youngest cone, which has a well-defined summit crater. An older lava dome is located to the west. Two sulfur mines have been opened on the NW and SE flanks."
"Taapaca","-69.500,-18.100","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112025.jpg","","The Taapaca volcanic complex, lying west of the main Andean chain, rises NE of the small town of Putre in northern Chile. The elongated volcanic massif, known locally as Nevados de Putre, consists of an initial andesitic stratovolcano and a long-term dacitic lava-dome complex. Taapaca overlies Pleistocene ignimbrite deposits and trends roughly E-W, with activity in general migrating to the SW during four principal periods of activity dating back at least 1.5 million years. At least three major edifice collapse events have produced debris-avalanche deposits, the youngest of which underlies Putre, the principal settlement of the northern Chilean Altiplano. Recent geological studies have shown that explosive activity at Taapaca with dome growth and associated block-and-ash flows and lahars has continued into the late Holocene. The youngest volcanic stage beginning about 9000 years ago produced the 5860-m-high summit lava dome of the Putre Unit at the eastern and southern ends of the complex. The latest documented activity produced an ash layer dated at about 2000 years ago."
"Parinacota","-69.142,-18.166","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112028.jpg","","Volcán Parinacota is the southernmost and youngest of a pair of volcanoes forming the Nevados de Payachata volcanic group along the Chile-Bolivia border. The symmetrical, 6336-m-high Parinacota volcano forms a twin volcano with the dominantly Pleistocene, 6222-m-high Pomerape volcano, which towers above a low saddle to the NE. Collapse of Parinacota about 8000 years ago produced a 6 cu km debris avalanche that traveled 22 km W and blocked drainages, forming Lake Chungará. Holocene eruptive activity has subsequently reconstructed the Parinacota stratovolcano, which contains a pristine, 300-m-wide summit crater and youthful lava flows on the western flanks. Although no historical eruptions are known, Helium surface-exposure dates have been obtained for eruptions during the past two thousand years both from the main cone and the Ajata group of satellite cones and lava flows on the S and SW flanks."
"Tacora","-69.770,-17.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112001.jpg","","Tacora, the northernmost volcano of Chile, is a twin volcano with Chupiquiña to the north and lies near the Peruvian border. The andesitic volcano overlies a flat-lying platform of ignimbrites at about 4200 m elevation forming the Arica Altiplano. The roughly conical edifice is covered by glaciers down to about 5500 m elevation, and an explosion crater lies on the NW side 300 m below the summit. Solfataric and fumarolic activity has been reported on the east side (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World), but Moreno (1985 pers. comm.) indicated there may not have been Holocene eruptions. Young lava flows on the S flank appear to overlie glacial valleys (de Silva 2007, pers. comm.). Hantke (1939b) cited a report of eruptions in 1930 and 1937 that are not listed in other sources. Numerous sulfur mines occupy the saddle between Tacora and Chupiquiña, and hot springs are located on the eastern side of Tacora."
"Tambo Quemado","-68.750,-18.620","A low pyroclastic shield near the Rio Lauca forms Cerro Volcán Tambo Quemado on the Bolivian Altiplano. The extremely youthful-looking volcanic complex (also known as Cerro Quemado or Volcán Sacabaya) displays fumarolic activity and is estimated to be of Holocene age. Tambo Quemado consists of a broad ignimbrite shield capped by an elongated NNE-SSW-trending vent area about 2 x 3.5 km in diameter formed by three large overlapping craters. The youngest crater lies at the southern end of the 4215-m-high summit region and contains a blocky lava dome. Wind has redistributed tephra deposits to the east and south, forming aeolian sand dunes."
"Guallatiri","-69.092,-18.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112029.jpg","","One of northern Chile's most active volcanoes, Volcán Guallatiri is a symmetrical ice-clad stratovolcano at the SW end of the Nevados de Quimsachata volcano group. The 6071-m-high Guallatiri lies just west of the border with Bolivia and is capped by a central dacitic dome or lava complex, with the active vent situated at its southern side. Thick lava flows are prominent on the lower northern and western flanks of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcano. Minor explosive eruptions have been reported from Guallatiri since the beginning of the 19th century. Intense fumarolic activity with 'jet-like' noises continues, and numerous solfataras extend more than 300 m down the west flank."
"Tata Sabaya","-68.530,-19.130","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111098.jpg","","The symmetrical Tata Sabaya stratovolcano towers above the northern end of the Salar de Coipasa in the Altiplano of Bolivia. A pyroclastic shield capped by lava domes was topped by effusive eruptions that formed an unglaciated andesitic stratovolcano. Collapse of this edifice produced a large late-Pleistocene debris avalanche that swept into the Salar de Coipasa and covered an area of more than 300 sq km south of the volcano, traveling up to 30 km. Tufa deposits on avalanche hummocks in the Salar de Coipasa correspond to a ca. 12,000 year old high stand of the lake. Renewed eruptions during the Holocene constructed lava domes and flows that have restored much of the original edifice, producing the present-day stratovolcano, whose summit is formed by a 5430-m-high lava dome. Youthful lava flows extend down the NW and western flanks of the volcano, and pyroclastic-flow deposits from partial collapse of the summit dome extend to the lower SW flank."
"Jayu Khota, Laguna","-67.432,-19.463","Two small youthful-looking maars are located in the Central Altiplano of Bolivia, north of Salar de Uyuni and east of Salar de Coipasa. Laguna Jayu Khota, initially considered to be a meteorite impact crater, was formed by basaltic-trachyandesite explosive volcanism. Nekhe Khota maar lies 4 km SW of Jayu Khota; both were considered by de Silva and Francis (1991) to be of probable Holocene age. Phreatomagmatic eruptions produced basaltic-trachyandesite pyroclastic deposits containing granitic xenoliths. The maars lie along a transverse lineament; the alkali basaltic cone of Chiar Kkollu is located nearby where this lineament intersects the regional trend."
"Nuevo Mundo","-66.480,-19.780","The Nuevo Mundo silicic lava dome and flow complex between Potosí and Uyuni in Bolivia is capped by pumice cones. Two viscous dacitic lava flows were erupted along a N-S fault and were associated with block-and-ash flows to the east. A later plinian explosive eruption produced an airfall-tephra deposit that extends as far as the renowned Bolivian mining center of Potosí, 200 km to the east. Nuevo Mundo was considered to be of late Pleistocene or Holocene age (de Silva, 2007 pers. comm.) and is the youngest volcanic center center of the vast Los Frailes ignimbrite plateau in the eastern Cordillera of Bolivia."
"Isluga","-68.830,-19.150","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/112048.jpg","","The broad Isluga volcano lies 7 km west of the Chile/Bolivia border at the west end of a group of volcanoes extending to Tata Sabaya volcano in Bolivia. The 5550-m-high Isluga stratovolcano contains a well-preserved, 400-m-wide summit crater at the western end of the elongated, snow-covered summit region. Numerous postglacial lava flows, many showing distinct levees, are most prominent along a broad front on the lower southern flank. Activity from the summit crater was reported in the 19th and 20th centuries. A lava flow in 1878 destroyed several towns."
"Pampa Luxsar","-68.200,-20.850","The Pampa Luxsar lava field consists of a 45 x 45 km area of coalesced lava flows at the SW margin of Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni, east of the Andean volcanic front. Several generations of lava flows and cones are present, but the youngest flows of the volcanic field, also spelled Pampa Luxar, were considered to be Holocene or late Pleistocene in age (de Silva 2007, pers. comm.). The young lava field partially or completely surrounds the older dissected stratovolcanoes of Cerro Luxsar and Cerro Uquila."
"Irruputuncu","-68.550,-20.730","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109077.jpg","","Irruputuncu is a small stratovolcano that straddles the Chile/Bolivia border. It is the youngest and most southerly of a NE-SW-trending chain of volcanoes. Irruputuncu was constructed within the collapse scarp of a Holocene debris avalanche whose deposit extends to the SW. Subsequent eruptions filled much of this scarp and produced thick, viscous lava flows down the western flank. The summit complex contains two craters, the southernmost of which is fumarolically active. The first unambiguous historical eruption from Irruputuncu took place in November 1995, when phreatic explosions produced dark ash clouds."
"Olca-Paruma","-68.413,-20.939","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109079.jpg","","A 15-km-long E-W ridge forming the border between Chile and Bolivia is comprised of several stratovolcanoes with Holocene lava flows. Andesitic-dacitic lava flows extend as far as 5 km N from the active crater of Volcán Olca and to the north and west from vents farther to the west. Olca is flanked on the west by Cerro Michincha and on the east by Volcán Paruma, which is immediately west of the higher pre-Holocene Cerro Paruma volcano. Volcán Paruma has been the source of conspicuous fresh lava flows, one of which extends 7 km SE. Volcán Paruma has displayed persistent fumarolic activity in recent years. The only known historical activity from the complex was a flank eruption of unspecified character between 1865 and 1867."
"Azufre, Cerro del","-68.237,-21.787","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114040.jpg","","Cerro del Azufre is the largest and youngest volcanic center of a 50-km-long, NW-SE-trending chain of Chilean volcanoes just west of the Bolivian border, south of Salar de Ascotán. The northern summit forms the 5846 m high point of the andesitic volcano; an older southern stratovolcano extends SE towards the Pleistocene Cerro Aguilucho volcano. A large group of late-Pleistocene lava flows originating from the northern cone extend toward the northern flanks and partially overlies a debris-avalanche deposit now largely buried by the Salar de Ascotán. The Chanka (Pabellón) dacitic lava-dome complex occupying the lower western flank is pristine-looking, but has been Potassium-Argon dated at 1.5 million years. Two possible Holocene dacitic lava domes that were erupted along a NW-SE line east of the summit ridge mark the most recent effusive activity of the Cerro del Azufre complex, but two youthful-looking craters on the main edifice could be of Holocene age."
"Ollague","-68.180,-21.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/069015.jpg","","Volcán Ollagüe, also known as Oyahué, is a massive andesitic stratovolcano with a summit dacitic lava dome. A large Pleistocene debris-avalanche deposit extending westward separates the Salar de San Martín from the Salar de Ollagüe. Three youthful-looking silicic lava flows mark late post-collapse eruptions, but show evidence of glaciation and are thought to pre-date the last glacial advance at about 11,000 years ago (Freeley et al., 1993). A youthful-looking scoria cone on the lower WSW flank, La Poruñita, was initially considered to be of Holocene age (González-Ferrán, 1995), however Wörner et al. (2000) later obtained Potassium-Argon dates of 420,000 to 680,000 years. Active sulfur mines on the upper western and southern flanks are reached by a road that climbs to about 5500 m elevation. No historical eruptions have been recorded; activity has been restricted to periods of intense fumarolic activity, and a persistent steam plume emanates from a fumarole on the south side of the summit dome."
"San Pedro","-68.400,-21.880","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068079.jpg","http://www.sernageomin.cl/camaras/El_Abra/fija/elabra.jpg","The composite volcano of San Pedro in the arid Atacama desert of northern Chile is one of the world's highest historically active volcanoes. The 6145-m-high basaltic andesite-to-dacitic edifice is W of its older twin volcano, 6092-m-high San Pablo. The youngest cone of San Pedro was constructed within a large horseshoe-shaped escarpment left by the collapse of an older edifice, which produced a large debris avalanche to the west, perhaps accompanied by a major pumice eruption. Thick dacitic lava flows with steep-sided fronts mantle the upper portion of the younger cone. The youthful-looking La Poruña scoria cone on the W flank produced an 8-km-long lava flow, but Worner et al. (2000) obtained a surprisingly old Helium surface-exposure age of 103,000 years from a juvenile block of the lava flow. Reports of variable reliability mention historical eruptions of San Pedro in the 19th and 20th centuries."
"Sairecabur","-67.892,-22.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111097.jpg","","This chain of andesitic-dacitic volcanoes along the Chile-Bolivia border contains at least 10 postglacial centers and stretches from Escalante volcano on the north to Sairecábur volcano on the south. Nomenclature reflecting local usage results in conflicting names applied to these features on Chilean and Bolivian topographic maps. The highest peak, Sairecábur, is located on the northern margin of a 4.5-km-wide caldera. Postglacial activity began south of the summit, but most recently produced a pristine lava flow to the NW. An active sulfur mine is located north of the volcano. Escalante, slightly older than Sairecábur, has a crater lake at its summit and youthful lava flows on its flanks, and other eruptive centers have also produced Holocene lava flows. Curinquinca volcano of Pleistocene-Holocene age lies at the NE end of the complex and Cerro Colorado volcano at the NW end."
"Licancabur","-67.880,-22.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068085.jpg","","The symmetrical Licancabur stratovolcano was constructed primarily during the Holocene and contains one of the world's highest lakes in its 400-m-wide summit crater. The Pleistocene Juriques volcano is located immediately to the SE and is capped by a 1.5-km-wide summit crater. Archaeological ruins were found on the 5916-m-high crater rim of the steep-sided Volcán Licancabur, which maintains constant 30 degree slopes. The shallow freshwater summit lake is 90 m by 70 m wide and has a measured temperature of 6 degrees C, supporting growth of planktonic fauna at nearly 6000 m altitude. Young blocky andesitic lava flows with prominent levees extend up to 6 km down the NW-to-SW flanks; older flows reach up to 15 km from the summit crater and are covered by pyroclastic-flow deposits that extend 12 km. The most recent activity from Licancabur produced flank lava flows."
"Guayaques","-67.566,-22.895","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111024.jpg","","The Cerros de Guayaques group of N-S-trending rhyodacitic lava domes straddles the Chile-Bolivia border. The 10-km-long chain is located immediately east of the Purico pyroclastic shield. There is some evidence for Holocene activity, and the youngest domes appear to be north of the summit crater of the dome complex (de Silva and Francis, 1991). A well-defined summit crater was the source of the largest lava flows, which traveled 3 km to the SW. There are no records of historical activity from Guayaques volcano."
"Purico Complex","-67.750,-23.000","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111025.jpg","","The Purico volcanic complex consists of two ignimbrite sheets, separated by a short erosional interval, that were erupted about 1.3 million years ago, along with several stratovolcanoes and lava domes that define a postulated 10 x 20 km ring fracture. Cerro Toco volcano overlies the vent area of the Cajón Ignimbrite and a sulfur mine on its SE flank was mined until the early 1990s. The youngest lava domes, Cerro Chascón de Purico and Cerro Aspero are of Holocene age (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Both domes differ morphologically from many other flat-topped silicic Andean volcanic domes and have 300-400 m high conical profiles. Cerro Chascón was formed by a series of viscous lava flows, whereas Cerro Aspero appears to be a single Pelean-type dome. The Chascón de Purico dacitic dome rising 1200 m above the ignimbrite shield has a well-preserved summit crater and lava flows that show no evidence of glacial modification. The dacitic-to-andesitic Macon stratovolcano of Holocene age lies at the southern end of the complex, and the Alitar maar at the SE end displays constant solfataric activity."
"Colachi","-67.645,-23.236","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068086.jpg","","Colachi is a 5631-m-high andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano that was constructed on an uplifted block of welded ignimbrites. The most recent activity produced pristine silicic lava flows of probable Holocene age, the largest of which covers a 7 sq km area on the saddle between Colachi and the neighboring volcano of Acamarachi (de Silva and Francis, 1991). A smaller flow was erupted on the western flank of Colachi. The closely spaced Colachi and Acamarachi volcanoes represent different magmatic systems (Gardeweg 1993, pers. comm.)."
"Acamarachi","-67.620,-23.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068087.jpg","","Acamarachi, a steep-sided andesitic-dacitic volcano with slopes that reach about 45 degrees, forms the highest peak in this part of the northern Andes. Acamarachi, also known as Cerro Pili, is at the SSE end of a small volcanic complex that extends from the neighboring volcano Colachi to the NNW. A large lava dome is located on the north flank of the 6046-m-high volcano. A poorly preserved summit crater and the absence of youthful flank lava flows suggest that Acamarachi was largely constructed in pre-Holocene times, although the summit lava flows draping the upper cone were considered to be of Holocene age (González-Ferrán, 1995)."
"Overo, Cerro","-67.670,-23.520","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/090016.jpg","","The solitary Cerro Overo maar is located on the lower NE flank of Chiliques volcano, west of the Salar de Aguas Calientes. The youthful morphology of the maar suggests a possible Holocene age. The 600-m-wide, 80-m-deep mafic maar produced the least silicic youthful volcanic rocks found in this part of the central Andes."
"Chiliques","-67.700,-23.580","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109096.jpg","","Volcán Chiliques is a structurally simple stratovolcano located immediately south of Laguna Lejía. The 5778-m-high summit contains a 500-m-wide crater. Several youthful lava flows, some of which are considered to be of possible Holocene age (de Silva, 2007 pers. comm.), descend its flanks. The largest of these extends 5 km to the NW. Older lava flows reach up to 10 km from the summit on the north flank. This volcano had previously been considered to be dormant; however, in 2002 a NASA nighttime thermal infrared satellite image from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) showed low-level hot spots in the summit crater and upper flanks."
"Putana","-67.850,-22.550","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117055.jpg","","Volcán Putana, also known as Jorgencal or Machuca, is part of a large, roughly N-S-trending volcanic complex that covers an area of 600 sq km. Vigorous fumarolic activity is visible at the 5890-m-high summit of Putana volcano from long distances. The main edifice, which formed primarily by lava effusion, consists of accumulated postglacial dacitic lava domes and flows mantling an older pre-Holocene volcano. The youngest basaltic andesite lava flows are viscous and rarely extend more than 3 km. A major eruption of unspecified character was reported in the early 19th century (Rudolph, 1955; Guest 1981, pers. comm.), although González-Ferrán (1995) indicated that no historical eruptions had occurred."
"Cordon de Puntas Negras","-67.534,-23.743","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068090.jpg","","Two intersecting volcanic chains, the Cordón de Puntas Negras and Cordón Chalviri, trend roughly SE from Chiliques volcano to Volcán Puntas Negras stratovolcano and SW from there to Cerro Tuyajto, respectively. The chain of small cones, lava domes, lava flows, and maars covers an area of about 500 sq km and contains at least 25 different vents. The Cordón de Puntas Negras is situated along the southern margin of the 35 x 70 km Pliocene La Pacana caldera. The pristine morphology of many of the volcanic features indicates a Holocene (de Silva and Francis, 1991) or historical (González-Ferrán, 1995) age. Small cones such as Cerros Cenizas, Aguas Calientes, Laguna Escondida, and Chinchilla have well-preserved summit craters and produced short lava flows. A distinct maar-type vent is present, as well as a 13 sq km silicic lava flow and dome complex. A volcanic center immediately SE of Cerro Laguna Escondida appears to be the youngest vent of the complex."
"Miniques","-67.770,-23.820","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/120079.jpg","","Volcán Miñiques is a large basaltic-andesite to dacitic volcanic complex south of Laguna Miscanti and Laguna Miñiques. The 5910-m-high summit of the volcano is cut by three overlapping, E-W-trending craters. Larger craters, partially filled by lava domes and flows, are located west and NE of the summit. The stratovolcano and lava-dome complex was considered to have been active from the Pliocene to the Holocene (González-Ferrán, 1995); de Silva (2007 pers. comm.) assigned it a possible Holocene age. A prominent lava flow extends NW-ward from the summit to the lower flanks, separating Laguna Miñiques from Laguna Miscanti."

The maar is located SE of the Salar de Atacama, north of Cerro Toloncha."
"Caichinque","-67.730,-23.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111029.jpg","","Caichinque is a relatively small Pleistocene-Holocene volcanic complex that forms a topographic high dividing Salar Capur from Salar Talar. More than a half dozen vents produced andesitic-to-dacitic lava flows, with young flows descending to the NE and SE from the 4450-m-high summit. One prominent flow traveled 6 km to the east, forming two lobes extending into the Salar Talar. The youthful morphology of the flows suggested a prehistorical age (González-Ferrán, 1995), but de Silva (2007 pers. comm.) considered the volcanic complex to perhaps be as old as late Pleistocene."
"Tilocalar","-68.130,-23.970","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/111030.jpg","","Two small stratovolcanoes, the Volcánes de Tilocálar, lie about 3 km apart in the Callejón de Tilocálar area. The volcanoes overlie Pliocene ignimbrites and were considered to be of Pleistocene-Holocene age by González-Ferrán (1995). The larger volcano, Tilocálar Sur, lies about 3.5 km SW of the northern volcano, Tilocálar Norte. Four basaltic-andesite to andesitic lava flows originated from 3116-m-high Tilocálar Sur, and an explosion crater lies a kilometer to the south. The 3040-m-high Tilocálar Norte lies near the eastern wall of the Callejón de Tilocálar and produced lava flows that traveled primarily to the north."

Gardeweg (1993, pers. comm.), however, did not consider El Negrillar to be of Holocene age. This volcanic field, also known as Negros de Aras, lies about 20 km north of Socompa volcano. The major Holocene debris avalanche from Socompa overlies some youthful-looking lava flows at the western margin of El Negrillar lava-flow complex."
"Pular","-68.054,-24.188","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115038.jpg","","Cerros Pular on the NE and Pajonales on the SW form a 12-km-long volcanic ridge that is mostly pre-Holocene, but may show evidence for some Holocene activity. The chain lies NW of the Salar de Pular, about 15 km west of the Argentinian border. Andesitic lava flows from the chain, which lies NE of Socompa volcano, overlie dacitic lava domes. The extensive lava flows reach the lower flanks of the chain, and about 10 craters are present. A major satellite vent west of the ridge, also known as Cerro Pajonales, appears to be the youngest feature of the volcanic complex. An uncertain small explosive eruption was reported in 1990, but the vent location was not known."
"Negrillar, La","-68.600,-24.280","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115039.jpg","","The La Negrillar cone and lava flow complex (also known as Aguas Perdidas) covers a roughly 16 km area along the SW margin of the Atacama basin and was interpreted to be of Holocene age by de Silva and Francis (1991). Gardeweg (1993, pers. comm.), however, did not consider La Negrillar to be of Holocene age, and de Silva (2007 pers. comm.) noted that it was not as youthful looking as the other El Negrillar complex to the north, although it did show leveed lava flows and pristine craters. This basaltic-andesite volcanic field, distinct from El Negrillar (north of Socompa), lies WSW of Socompa volcano between the Sierra San Juan and Sierra Almeida."
"Socompa","-68.246,-24.396","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068091.jpg","","Straddling the Chile-Argentina border, Volcán Socompa is a massive, 6051-m-high dacitic stratovolcano that lies immediately north of the only railway line between the two countries. Socompa is the youngest and southernmost of a 6000-m-high NE-SW-trending chain of volcanoes including Pular and Pajonales. In contrast to the latter two volcanoes, no glacial moraines have been observed on the youthful and relatively uneroded Socompa. Collapse of the NW portion of Socompa volcano about 7200 years ago, during an eruption similar to that at Mount St. Helens in 1980, produced a 600 sq km debris-avalanche deposit that extends about 40 km from the summit and is one of the world's largest and best exposed. Post-collapse eruptions have constructed dacitic lava domes that have filled much of the head of the collapse scarp. No historical eruptions are known from Socompa."
"Lascar","-67.730,-23.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/048035.jpg","http://www.sernageomin.cl/lascar.php","Láscar is the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes. The andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcano contains six overlapping summit craters. Prominent lava flows descend its NW flanks. An older, higher stratovolcano 5 km E, Volcán Aguas Calientes, displays a well-developed summit crater and a probable Holocene lava flow near its summit (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Láscar consists of two major edifices; activity began at the eastern volcano and then shifted to the western cone. The largest eruption took place about 26,500 years ago, and following the eruption of the Tumbres scoria flow about 9000 years ago, activity shifted back to the eastern edifice, where three overlapping craters were formed. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ashfall hundreds of kilometers away. The largest historical eruption took place in 1993, producing pyroclastic flows to 8.5 km NW of the summit and ashfall in Buenos Aires."
"Escorial","-68.367,-25.083","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109076.jpg","","Cerro Escorial, a small andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano, has young-looking lava flows and a well-preserved crater. It is the youngest volcanic center of the NW-SE-trending Corrida de Cori range that marks the Chile/Argentina border. Escorial is located 4 km NE of an active sulfur mine in older, extensively hydrothermally altered rocks. Very youthful-looking lava flows extend westward 3-4 km over an ignimbrite deposit on the Chilean side. A 1-km-wide crater caps the summit. Escorial was considered by de Silva and Francis (1991) to be of probable Holocene age based on morphological evidence, but Richards and Villeneuve (2002) obtained an Ar/Ar age of about 0.342 million years on a lava flow. Most of the lava flows extend to the SW into Chile, but a few small lobes traveled NE on the Argentinian side of the volcano. De Silva (2007 pers. comm.) noted that the well-preserved summit crater postdates the lava flow and could be of Holocene age."
"Llullaillaco","-68.530,-24.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/068100.jpg","","The world's highest historically active volcano, 6739-m-high Llullaillaco, sits astride the Chile-Argentina border. The summit is formed by a smaller well-preserved cone that was constructed on an older Pleistocene edifice. A major debris-avalanche deposit produced by collapse of the older volcano about 150,000 years ago extends eastward into Argentina and diverges around the north and south sides of the older Cerro Rosado stratovolcano 17 km east of Llullaillaco. Construction of several lava domes and flows was associated with growth of the modern cone. The two most prominent flows contain distinct flow levees and ridges and extend down the northern and southern flanks. These two extremely youthful-looking dacitic flows were initially considered to be of Holocene age, but more recent Ar/Ar dating indicates that they are of late Pleistocene age (Richards and Villeneuve, 2001). Two explosive eruptions and another that may have included lava effusion were reported from Llullaillaco in the 19th century."
"Cordon del Azufre","-68.521,-25.336","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115040.jpg","","Cordón del Azufre is a small volcanic complex straddling the Chile-Argentina border. The complex consists of a cluster of lava flows from vents on the NE side, wholly within Argentina, and a 5-km-long chain of vents along the border with Chile. An older andesitic-dacitic edifice with a 1.3-km-wide crater was mostly covered by younger Holocene andesitic lava flows. The youngest cone, 300-m-high Volcán la Moyra, was the source of fresh-looking blocky andesitic lava flows that descended 6 km into Chile and 3 km into Argentina."

An older center to the south contains a poorly preserved, 800-m-wide crater. A younger northern center along the national border has a well-preserved 400-m-wide crater and produced lava flows to the north and NE. The 5401-m-high summit of the Cerro Bayo complex, located west of the border in Chile, is the source of two viscous dacitic lava flows that traveled to the north and represent the most recent activity of the complex."
"Nevada, Sierra","-68.580,-26.480","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/114048.jpg","","The Sierra Nevada volcanic complex, located in one of the most inaccessible parts of the Central Andes, covers an area of about 225 sq km astride the Chile-Argentina border.

Craters up to 400 m in diameter and large andesitic lava flows that extend up to 7 km with well-developed flow ridges are present. The oldest part of the complex, at its eastern end in Argentina, includes two stratovolcanoes, one with a 1-km-wide summit crater."

The western portion includes the high point and principal edifice of the complex, Cerro Falso Azufre, and consists of overlapping craters that produced dominantly pyroclastic products. The eastern portion, located wholly in Argentina, contains two small composite cones and two lava domes that appear to represent the most recent activity of the complex and may be of Holocene age (de Silva, 2007 pers. comm.)."
"Incahuasi, Nevado de","-68.296,-27.033","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109100.jpg","","Nevado de Incahuasi is a complex volcanic massif that straddles the Chile-Argentina border ENE of Nevados Ojos del Salado volcano. Two stratovolcanoes occupy a compound 3.5-km-wide caldera, and Pleistocene lava domes are located on the W and SW flanks of the 6638-m-high volcano. The youngest stratovolcano is capped by a 1-km-wide crater, and dacitic lava flows radiate down the volcano's flanks. The fresh-looking morphology of the youngest products suggest a Holocene (González-Ferrán, 1995) or possible Holocene (de Silva 2007, pers. comm.) age. A dacitic lava dome partially fills an arcuate crater on the eastern flank of Incahuasi (which means 'House of the Inca' in Quechua). Four pyroclastic cones are located 7 km to NE and produced basaltic-andesite lava flows that cover an area of 10 sq km."

The youngest feature is a lava dome that overlaps the northern crater rim. The large andesitic-dacitic Negriales lava field on the western flanks was erupted from a single SW-flank vent. A large debris-avalanche deposit is found on the SE flank. Recent pyroclastic-flow deposits form an extensive apron below the northern flanks of the volcano. Although no historical eruptions have been recorded, the youthful morphology of deposits suggests activity during historical time. Persistent fumarolic activity occurs at the summit and NW flank, and sulfur flows have been produced by melting of extensive sulfur deposits in the summit region."
"Solo, El","-68.713,-27.105","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/069002.jpg","","El Solo is large stratovolcano composed of nine eruptive centers located west of Nevados del Ojos de Salado and SE of Tres Cruces volcano.

"Ojos del Salado, Nevados","-68.541,-27.109","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/069007.jpg","","The world's highest active volcano, Nevados Ojos del Salado, rises to 6,879 m along the Chile-Argentina border. The volcano lies about 20 km south of the road that crosses the international border at Paso de San Francisco. The summit complex, which is elongated in a NE-SW direction and overlies a largely buried caldera, contains numerous craters, pyroclastic cones and andesitic-to-rhyolitic lava domes and has been the source of Holocene lava flows. A major rhyodacitic explosive eruption about 1000-1500 years ago produced pumiceous pyroclastic flows. The most recent eruptive activity appears to have originated along a NNE-trending rift along the summit complex. It involved formation of a thick, viscous lava flow and at least a dozen small cones, lava domes, and explosion craters. No confirmed historical eruptions have been recorded, but the volcano has displayed persistent fumarolic activity, and there was an unconfirmed report of minor gas-and-ash emission in 1993."
"Copiapo","-69.130,-27.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085017.jpg","","Volcán Copiapó in Atacama province SW of Nevados Ojos del Salado volcano is a dominantly Miocene-Pliocene stratovolcano. Eight andesitic pyroclastic cones are located primarily on the SE flank of the 6052-m-high volcano. The most recent cone, Volcán San Román, lies 7 km north of Copiapó and was considered to be of probable Pleistocene age, related to late-stage reactivation of Pleistocene-Holocene fissures cutting the Ojos del Salado region (González-Ferrán, 1995). This dacitic-to-andesitic volcano was reported by Von Wolff (1929) to display solfataric activity."
"Tuzgle","-66.480,-24.050","The easternmost young stratovolcano of the central Andes, Cerro Tuzgle is located in Argentina about 120 km E of the main volcanic arc. Many youthful-looking flank lava flows were erupted from the well-preserved summit crater. Schwab and Lippolt (1976) obtained a Potassium-Argon date of 0.1 million years ago on what they believed to be the youngest Tuzgle lava. However, de Silva and Francis (1991) and González-Ferrán (1995) considered the latest activity to be of Holocene age, and Coira and Kay (1993, Fig. 2B) placed the youngest flow at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Activity began with the eruption of a rhyodacitic ignimbrite, followed by construction of a lava dome complex on the rim of an existing caldera. Andesitic lava flows covered much of the dome complex and later partially filled the crater. Several edifice-collapse events occurred during the evolution of the volcano. The youngest flows were erupted on the SE and SW flanks."
"Aracar","-67.783,-24.290","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110089.jpg","","Aracar is a steep-sided stratovolcano with a youthful-looking summit crater 1-1.5 km in diameter that contains a small lake. It is located just east of the Argentina-Chile border. The volcano was constructed during three eruptive cycles dating back to the Pliocene. The andesitic stratovolcano overlies dacitic lava domes. Lava flows found at the base of the volcano below 4500 m elevation are relatively well preserved, but upper-flank lavas, often an indication of youthful activity, are not present (de Silva, 2007 pers. comm.). There were reports of possible ash columns from the summit in 1993, but it is not known whether these were rockfall dust or eruption plumes."
"Unnamed","-68.270,-25.100","An isolated basaltic-andesite cinder cone was constructed on top of Miocene ignimbrites and lava flows between the Corrida de Cori range on the Chile/Argentina border and the Salar Río Grande in Argentina. Blocky lava flows from the cone descended in a broad lobe to the SE and in a narrow tongue to the east nearly to the Salar Río Grande. A second smaller vent lies about 800 m NW of the cinder cone. The relatively fluid lava flows display surficial breadcrust textures and were considered by Richards and Villeneuve (2002) to be very young, possibly of Holocene age."
"Antofagasta","-67.400,-26.120","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096014.jpg","","The Antofagasta de la Sierra volcanic field contains some of the youngest volcanic vents of the Argentinian Puna region. The volcanic field is located SW of Beltran volcano and between the Salar de Antofalla on the west and the massive Cerro Galán caldera on the east. The Antofagasta de la Sierra volcanic field contains several very youthful looking basaltic-andesite scoria cones and fresh-looking lava flows, which may only be a few thousand years old (Francis, 1982; de Silva and Francis, 1991). A concentration of scoria cones and lava flows east of the NE-SW-trending Salar de Antofalla, known as the Salar de Antofalla volcanic field, also have a youthful appearance, although precise ages are not known."

The complex lies to the north of Falso Azufre volcano, which straddles the Chile/Argentina border. The summit contains several ash cones and craters that have been the source of a number of pristine lava flows, one of which traveled 10 km to the west. Satellitic centers also abound; one on the east flank produced a fresh-looking lava flow that traveled 8 km to the east. The morphologically youthful lava flows and pristine summit crater imply a Holocene age (de Silva and Francis, 1991)."
"Peinado","-68.116,-26.623","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/096012.jpg","","This symmetrical Argentinian stratovolcano is the source of well-preserved lava flows of Holocene age from summit and flank vents (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Cerro Peinado is one of the youngest volcanoes in the region. The upper part of the 5741-m-high cone is blanketed by pyroclastic material. Two possible pyroclastic-flow lobes extend to the NW and north. An apron of pristine lava flows that extends to 6 km were erupted from the main cone and from vents on the flank, including a prominent ESE-flank vent. It is surrounded by small fields of cinder cones, maars, and pristine lava flows, located along N-S-trending faults, which are related to the Salar de Antofalla volcanic field."
"Blanco, Cerro","-67.765,-26.789","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/107086.jpg","","The Cerro Blanco volcanic complex contains the 6-km-wide Cerro Blanco caldera (also known as the Robledo caldera) in NW Argentina and is located 80 km SW of the much larger and better known Cerro Galán caldera. Cerro Blanco was the site of the largest known Holocene eruption in the Central Andes about 4200 years BP (Fernandez-Turiel et al., 2013). The rhyolitic eruption produced plinian ashfall deposits of about 110 cu km and widespread ignimbrite deposits. The Holocene Cerro Blanco del Robledo lava dome is located on the southern rim of the caldera and is surrounded by extensive rhyolitic pumice-fall deposits. Satellite geodetic surveys in the central Andes (Pritchard and Simons, 2002) showed subsidence of the caldera in the 1990s."
"Tipas","-68.561,-27.196","This massive volcanic complex is the world's third highest active volcano, but remains largely unknown. Cerro Tipas (also known as Walter Penk or Cazadero), is located immediately SSW of its better known neighbor, 6879-m-high Nevados Ojos del Salado, Earth's highest volcano. The 6658-m-high summit of Tipas lies within Argentina, immediately south of the Chilean border. This volcanic complex of craters, cones, lava domes and lava flows covers an area of 25 sq km. It displays a youthful morphology, and its latest eruptions were considered by de Silva and Francis (1991) to be of Holocene age."
"Aucanquilcha","-68.470,-21.220","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/101039.jpg","","The world's highest permanent human habitation is situated below a sulfur mine at the summit region of Cerro Aucanquilcha, one the largest volcanoes of northern Chile. Several distinct cones are located along a 10-km-long, E-W-trending ridge that forms the broad summit of the 6176-m-high stratovolcano. A Pleistocene debris-avalanche deposit is a prominent feature on the lower NW flank. Extensive Pleistocene glacial moraines surround the volcano, but postglacial lava flows overlie these moraines on the upper southern flanks (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Wörner et al. (2000) obtained surprisingly old Potassium-Argon dates of from 400,000 to 780,000 years on the youngest flows of the volcano on the NE and SW flanks, and eruptive activity appears to have ended during the late Pleistocene. Aucanquilcha presently displays fumarolic activity."
"Uturuncu","-67.180,-22.270","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/108047.jpg","","Uturuncu, the highest peak of SW Bolivia, displays fumarolic activity, and postglacial lava flows were noted by Kussmaul et al. (1977). Inspection of satellite images of the 6008-m-high peak, located SE of Quetana, did not show evidence for postglacial activity (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Andesitic and dacitic lava flows dominate on Uturuncu, and no pyroclastic deposits were observed during recent field work. Although young lava flows display well-preserved flow features, youthful-looking summit lava flows showed evidence of glaciation. Two active sulfur-producing fumarole fields are located near the summit, and large-scale ground deformation was observed beginning in May 1992 (Pritchard and Simons, 2002), indicating, along with seismicity detected in 2009-10 (Jay et al., 2012), that a magmatic system is still present."
"Easter Island","-109.380,-27.150","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085024.jpg","","The triangular-shaped Easter Island, renowned for its dramatic megalithic statues of hand-carved basalt, sits atop the Sala y Gomez submarine ridge, which trends eastward from the East Pacific Rise. Easter Island, also known as Isla de Pascua or Rapa Nui, forms the westernmost territory of Chile. The island is composed of three principal volcanoes and more than 70 subsidiary vents. Rano Kau, which contains a flat-bottomed, 1-km-wide crater, and Poike volcano form the SW and east tips of the island, respectively, and are of Pleistocene age. The youngest and largest volcano, Terevaka, is a broad shield volcano of Pliocene-to-Pleistocene age at the northern leg of the triangular island, which is capped by many pyroclastic cones. The last stage of activity consisted of eruptions from multiple rift zones extending along the axes of the island and radially from them. The latest lava flows, at Hiva-Hiva near the west-central coast, are thought to be less than 2000 years old."

Tupungatito consists of a group of 12 Holocene andesitic and basaltic andesite craters and a pyroclastic cone at the NW end of the 4-km-wide, Pleistocene dacitic Nevado Sin Nombre caldera, which is filled by glaciers at its southern end and is breached to the NW. Lava flows from the northernmost vent have traveled down the NW flank breach. Tupungatito has produced frequent mild explosive eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries."
"Maipo","-69.832,-34.164","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/069021.jpg","","Maipo, a conical stratovolcano that straddles the Chile-Argentina border SE of Santiago, partially fills the 16 x 20 km Pleistocene Diamante caldera, which formed about 0.45 million years ago during an eruption that produced an about 350 cu km rhyolitic ignimbrite. The Pleistocene cones of Volcán Don Casimiro and Cerro Listado were formed on the SW rim and SW flank of the caldera, respectively. The post-caldera Maipo stratovolcano rises about 1900 m above the caldera floor and was constructed by strombolian-vulcanian explosions. It has a youthful appearance, and ashfall deposits overlie glacial ice. Several parasitic cones were constructed on the east flank of Maipo along a series on en échelon NE-trending fractures. Lava flows from one of these cones blocked drainages in 1826 inside the caldera, forming Lake Diamante on the eastern caldera floor."

The 8 x 10 km alkaline caldera of Cerro Payún Matrú was formed after about 168,000 years ago. The high point of the massif, Cerro Payen stratovolcano, was constructed on the SW flank of the shield. The Pleistocene Pampas Onduladas pahoehoe lava flow traveled 181 km, Earth's longest known Quaternary lava flow. Post-caldera basaltic eruptions produced more than 300 eruptive centers, mostly along E-W-trending fissures that extend across the entire shield volcano. Fluid aa lava flows from a youthful concentration of vents on the W flank known as Los Volcanes traveled more than 10 km. Other vent clusters of the 5200 sq km volcanic field are found on the lower NE and southern flanks, and a lava flow from Volcán Santa María on the NW flank traveled 15 km to the NE. At least 30 trachyandesitic lava domes and basaltic lava flows were erupted contemporaneously with the basaltic fissure eruptions. The Puente and Chapua volcanic units east of the main shield and south of the Ondulas flow are considered part of the field. Oral traditions note that native tribes were present at the time of the latest eruption."

The three basaltic-andesite 'La Resoloma Craters' scoria vents are located below the west flank and the two 'Los Hornitos' scoria cones on the lower SW flank. Quizapu, a major vent on the northern flank of Cerro Azul, formed in 1846 during the first historical eruption, accompanied by the emission of voluminous dacitic lava flows that traveled both east into the Estero Barroso valley and west into the Río Blanquillo valley. Quizapu was later the source of one of the world's largest explosive eruptions of the 20th century in 1932, which created a 600-700 m wide, 150-m-deep crater and ejected 9.5 cu km of dacitic tephra."
"Tromen","-70.033,-37.144","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/121002.jpg","","Tromen is an Argentinian stratovolcano that is the primary structure in an elongated volcanic plateau or field that extends about 70 km from Tilhue in the S to Piujenta in the N, including the Boliviano caldera and Palao dome. The summit of Tromen is cut by two overlapping 3.5-km-wide calderas. The Pleistocene Volcán Cerro Negro del Tromen, with a 5-km-wide caldera, lies immediately north, and lava flows have partially overtopped the northern caldera rim. At the SSW end of this N-S-trending chain is Cerro Tilhue, of Pleistocene-Holocene age. Post-caldera vents at Tromen were constructed inside both calderas and on the flanks of the NE-most caldera. The youngest lava flows originated from flank vents and descended the N and NE sides of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcanic complex. Holocene vents are also located in the Cerro Michico area on the lower NE flank. Historical eruptions were reported in the mid-18th century and in 1822. Von Wolff (1929) attributed purported eruptions of Pomahuida in 1820, 1823, 1827, 1828 as being from Tromen, but these are not confirmed."

Antuco has a complicated history beginning with construction of the basaltic-to-andesitic Sierra Velluda and Cerro Condor stratovolcanoes of Pliocene-Pleistocene age. Construction of the Antuco I volcano was followed by edifice failure at the beginning of the Holocene that produced a large debris avalanche which traveled down the Río Laja to the west and left a large 5-km-wide horseshoe-shaped caldera breached to the west. The steep-sided modern basaltic-to-andesitic cone of has grown 1000 m since then; flank fissures and cones have also been active.

Small craters 100-500 m in diameter are primarily found along a fissure extending down the SW flank. Intense solfataric activity occurs at the southern part of the summit; in 1966 and 1978, red glow was observed in fumarolic areas (Moreno 1985, pers. comm.). Periods of intense fumarolic activity have dominated at Callaqui, and few historical eruptions are known. An explosive eruption was reported in 1751, there were uncertain accounts of eruptions in 1864 and 1937, and a small phreatic ash emission was noted in 1980."

The volcano was formed in four eruptive stages dating back to the early Pleistocene or late Pliocene. The last two stages occurred during the late-Pleistocene and Holocene. A small lava dome at the summit fed blocky lava flows to the north about 2200 years ago. Lanín was reported active after an earthquake in 1906, but Sapper (1917) stated that newspaper accounts are strongly disputed, and no historical eruptions are known. A postglacial tuff ring (Volcán Arenal) is located below the SW flank in Argentina. A younger lava flow from Lanín covers deposits of Volcán Arenal and extends south into Lago Paimún."
"Huanquihue Group","-71.580,-39.887","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/118052.jpg","","A group of young basaltic volcanoes lies in Argentina near the Chilean border, south of Lanín volcano. The Huanquihué volcano group consists of a NNE-SSW-trending chain of stratovolcanoes of Pleistocene age, some of which lie along the border. A Holocene compound cinder cone with three nested craters up to 400 m in diameter that occupied a valley NE of Cerro Huanquihué and a tuff cone constructed within glacial Lake Epulafquen lies at the northern end of the chain. Growth of this Holocene tuff cone, La Angostura ('The Narrowing'), created a peninsula that formed a narrow channel connecting Lake Epulafquen and Lake Huechulafquen. A very recent lava flow from the base of the Achín-Niellu cinder cone (also known as Cerro Escorial) traveled north into glacial Lago Epulafquen, forming a prominent lava delta. The Escorial lava flow is an extremely youthful flow that diverted local drainages and formed new lakes. A radiocarbon date of about 200 years before present was obtained from this flow, and local residents recount oral histories of the eruption, which was observed by their grandparents."

It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andean chain. A 6-km wide caldera formed during the late Pleistocene. A 2-km-wide caldera that formed about 3500 years ago is located at the base of the presently active, dominantly basaltic to basaltic-andesitic cone at the NW margin of the Pleistocene caldera. More than 30 scoria cones and fissure vents dot Villarrica's flanks. Plinian eruptions and pyroclastic flows that have extended up to 20 km from the volcano have been produced during the Holocene. Lava flows up to 18 km long have issued from summit and flank vents. Historical eruptions, documented since 1558, have consisted largely of mild-to-moderate explosive activity with occasional lava effusion. Glaciers cover 40 sq km of the volcano, and lahars have damaged towns on its flanks."

Flank vents produced andesitic-dacitic lava flows and pyroclastic material. Collapse of the edifice produced a major debris avalanche that traveled to the SSW. Two large plinian eruptions have been documented from Monte Burney during the Holocene. The only known historical eruption of Monte Burney took place in 1910."
"Pali-Aike Volcanic Field","-69.698,-52.082","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/085026.jpg","","The 3000 sq km Pleistocene-to-Holocene Pali-Aike volcanic field straddles the Chile-Argentina border north of the Straits of Magellan, about 150 km NE of the town of Punta Arenas. The southernmost of the Patagonian basaltic plateau lavas, Pali-Aike contains lake-filled maars and basaltic scoria and spatter cones with associated fresh-looking lava flows. The distribution of maars and cones indicates that eruptions occurred along regional fissures oriented E-W and NW-SE. The earliest eruptions produced maars and associated lava flows that are now exposed only in river valleys. A second stage formed now-eroded spatter cones and soil-covered lava flows. The youngest cones and lava flows are found in the SE part of the volcanic field. The most recent volcanic event produced scoria and spatter cones and fresh lava flows not covered by soil. Ejecta covers prehistorical artifacts (Skewes and Stern, 1979)."
"Fueguino","-70.250,-54.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/115099.jpg","","A group of andesitic, columnar-jointed lava domes and pyroclastic cones up to 150 m high on Isla Cook mark the southernmost Holocene volcanoes of the Andes. The nearest Holocene volcanism occurs 400 km NW, at Monte Burney. The volcanoes, known as Volcán Cook or Volcán Fueguino, occupy a broad peninsula forming the SE end of Isla Cook. One of the cones, south of Bahía del Volcán, contains a 150-m-wide crater with a small lake. The lava domes and pyroclastic cones, possibly emplaced along N-S-trending faults, are unaffected by glacial erosion that scoured the underlying plutonic rocks. Passing navigators observed possible eruptive activity in the direction of Cook in 1712 and the eruption of incandescent ejecta in 1820."
"Meullin","-73.050,-45.220","The Meullín volcanic field consists of a chain of well-preserved cinder cones along the Lago Meullín, Lago Yulton, Río Cuervo, and Quitralco fault segments of the regional Liquine-Ofqui fault zone. The cones straddle both sides of the Aisén (Aysén) Fjord and were considered to be of Holocene age (Vargas et al., 2013). The cinder cones, a few of which are sub-aquatic, extend to the south along NE-SW, NNE-SSW, and N-S lines from Yulton Lake. The largest concentration of cones lies between Meullín Lake and the older Pleistocene Meullín volcano located west of the volcanic field, and additional forested cinder cones were constructed along the Río Pescado valley south of Aisén Fjord."
"Saba","-63.230,17.630","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094035.jpg","","Saba, the northernmost active volcano of the West Indies, is a small 5-km-diameter island forming the upper half of a large stratovolcano that rises 1500 m above the sea floor. Its eruptive history is characterized by the emplacement of lava domes and associated pyroclastic flows. The summit of the volcano, known as Mount Scenery (or The Mountain), is a Holocene lava dome that overtops a major collapse scarp that formed about 100,000 years ago. Flank domes were constructed on the SW, SE, east, and NE sides of the island near the coast. A large andesitic lava flow entered the sea on the NE flank, forming the Flat Point Peninsula, the only site level enough on which to locate the island's airport. The village of The Bottom overlies pyroclastic-surge deposits that contain European pottery fragments and were radiocarbon dated at 280 +/- 80 years before present. The village was settled in 1640 on grassy meadows on the volcano's flanks reflecting initial vegetation recovery following destruction of tropical rainforests by pyroclastic flows and surges. Lava dome growth may also have occurred during this SW-flank eruption."
"Quill, The","-62.960,17.478","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094040.jpg","","The Quill is a large dominantly andesitic stratovolcano that forms the SE end of St. Eustatius (Statia) Island. The 601-m-high volcano was formed about 32,000-22,000 years ago by rhyolitic eruptions on a shallow-water limestone bank 3 km offshore of an older 0.2 million years old volcanic center exposed at the NW end of the island. The interaction of rhyolitic magma with sea water produced pyroclastic-surge deposits, rich in limestone fragments, that joined the two islands and blanket the entire slopes of The Quill. The surges also swept across the older island and incorporated carbonized plant remains, shell fragments, and remains of fossil hermit crabs. A likely cryptodome tilted up limestones at Sugarloaf on the southern coast. A steep-sided crater, 760 m wide and more than 300 m deep caps The Quill; a notch on the western rim of the crater has directed the youngest pyroclastic flows towards the island's capital, Orangestad. The last dated eruption of The Quill produced pyroclastic flows about 1600 years ago."
"Liamuiga","-62.800,17.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094030.jpg","","Mount Liamuiga volcano, comprising the NW end of St. Kitts Island, contains a steep-walled, 1-km-wide summit crater, which contained a shallow lake until 1959. Two lava domes are located on the upper western flank, and intrusion of a 3rd dome, Brimstone Hill, on the lower SW flank uplifted a Pleistocene limestone block. Liamuiga volcano (sometimes referred to as Mount Misery) is the youngest of 3 NW-migrating volcanic centers on St. Kitts. Its most recent major eruptions less than 2000 years ago produced pyroclastic flows and mudflows whose deposits underlie populated coastal areas. Reports of possible historical eruptions in 1692 and 1843 are considered uncertain. An earthquake swarm occurred from late 1988 to early 1989, causing small landslides in the summit crater; another earthquake swarm took place in 1999-2000. Active fumaroles are found in the summit crater of Liamuiga."
"Nevis Peak","-62.580,17.150","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094036.jpg","","The conical island of Nevis, lying across a narrow channel from St. Kitts (St. Christopher) Island, is a composite cone with overlapping summit craters. An unnamed lava dome is located NE of the rims of the two craters. Nevis Peak, the 985 m high point of the island, is located on the outer crater rim. The inner crater truncates the western rim of the earlier crater and is widely breached on the west side. A small lava dome was emplaced within the inner crater in recent pre-Columbian time, and pyroclastic flows and mudflows were deposited on the lower slopes of the cone. Four lava domes were constructed on the flanks of the volcano. Madden's Mount and Butlers Mountain were built on the NE and eastern flanks, respectively; Mount Lily lies on the NW coast and Saddle mountain on the southern coast. No historical eruptions are known from Nevis, and the youngest dated eruption was about 100,000 years ago. Active fumaroles and hot springs are found on the island (the most recent of these formed in 1953 and remains active), and seismic swarms have occurred on several occasions during the 20th century."
"Soufrière Hills","-62.180,16.720","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/049066.jpg","","The complex, dominantly andesitic Soufrière Hills volcano occupies the southern half of the island of Montserrat. The summit area consists primarily of a series of lava domes emplaced along an ESE-trending zone. The volcano is flanked to Pleistocene complexes to the north and south. English's Crater, a 1-km-wide crater breached widely to the east by edifice collapse, was formed about 2000 years ago as a result of the youngest of several collapse events producing submarine debris-avalanche deposits. Block-and-ash flow and surge deposits associated with dome growth predominate in flank deposits, including those from an eruption that likely preceded the 1632 AD settlement of the island, allowing cultivation on recently devegetated land to near the summit of the volcano. Non-eruptive seismic swarms occurred at 30-year intervals in the 20th century, but no historical eruptions were recorded on Montserrat until 1995. Long-term small-to-moderate ash eruptions beginning in that year were later accompanied by lava-dome growth and pyroclastic flows that forced evacuation of the southern half of the island and ultimately destroyed the capital city of Plymouth, causing major social and economic disruption."
"Soufriere Guadeloupe","-61.664,16.044","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/049082.jpg","","La Soufrière de la Guadeloupe volcano occupies the southern end of Basse-Terre, the western half of the butterfly-shaped island of Guadeloupe. Construction of the Grand Découverte volcano about 0.2 million years ago (Ma) was followed by caldera formation after a plinian eruption about 0.1 Ma, and then by construction of the Carmichaël volcano within the caldera. Two episodes of edifice collapse and associated large debris avalanches formed the Carmichaël and Amic craters about 11,500 and 3100 years ago, respectively. The presently active La Soufrière volcano subsequently grew within the Amic crater. The summit consists of a flat-topped lava dome, and several other domes occur on the southern flanks. Most historical eruptions have originated from NW-SE-trending fissure systems that cut across the summit and upper flanks. A relatively minor phreatic eruption in 1976-77 caused severe economic disruption when Basse-Terre, the island's capital city, which lies immediately below the volcano, was evacuated."
"Diables, Morne aux","-61.430,15.612","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094033.jpg","","The relatively unknown 861-m-high Morne aux Diables (Devils' Peak) stratovolcano forms the northern tip of the island of Dominica. Several nested craters and a 90-m-high, 335-m-wide lava dome are located within a larger 1.2-km-wide crater. The complex overall includes seven andesitic lava domes with a central depression where a cold soufriere is located. A chain of lava domes, two of which form a peninsula on the SW flank, form an E-W belt across the southern flank of the volcano. Bathymetry shows a double-peaked lava dome (known informally as Twin Peaks) off the northern coast, which is truncated by a 4-km-long fault-bounded cliff. No eruptions are known from Morne aux Diables in historical time, although the volcano has a youthful appearance and activity at flank domes likely continued into the late-Pleistocene and Holocene. The youngest (NW) summit crater contains an active thermal area with bubbling springs. Severe earthquake swarms in 1841 and 1893 were associated with either Morne aux Diables or Morne Diablotins to the south. Shallow volcano-tectonic seismicity was detected as recently as February 2010."

A complex of at least five coalescing lava domes forms the broad summit of roughly 1430-m-high Morne Diablotins, and other domes are found to the SE. Pyroclastic-flow deposits emplaced about 22,000-40,000 years ago, known as the Grand Savanne Ignimbrite, extend in five radial tongues around the volcano as far as the coast. Precolumbian block-and-ash flow aprons on the NW flank are relatively unmodified by erosion. No historical eruptions are known from Morne Diablotins, although numerous hot springs, both onshore and submarine, are found near Glanvillia, on the NW flank. Severe earthquake swarms in 1841 and 1893 originated either from Morne Diablotins or Morne aux Diables to the north."

The two best-known volcanic features on Dominica, the Valley of Desolation and the Boiling Lake thermal areas, lie on the flank of Morne Watt; both are major tourist attractions within the national park on Dominica. Morne Anglais stratovolcano lies 4 km SW of Morne Watt and Grand Soufrière Hills volcano, with dated pyroclastic-flow producing eruptions about 10,000 years ago, lies 3 km to the east. A major eruption from Morne Watt producing pyroclastic flows took place about 1300 years ago. A moderately large phreatic explosion took place at the Valley of Desolation thermal area NE of Morne Watt in 1880, when ash fell over a 4-km-wide sector at the coast, 10 km from the vent. A smaller phreatic explosion occurred in July 1997, when ashfall was confined to the Valley of Desolation area. These mark the only known historical eruptions on the island of Dominica."
"Trois Pitons, Morne","-61.330,15.370","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/094042.jpg","","Two large lava-domes complexes, Morne Trois Pitons and Micotrin, rise NE of the capital city of Roseau in central Dominica. Micotrin (Morne Macaque) dome lies immediately south of the larger 1387-m-high Morne Trois Pitons; small lakes are located in the saddle between the two domes and on the eastern flank of Micotrin. The domes are located along the margin of a large semi-circular depression on the western coast of central Dominica, whose origin has been variously attributed to caldera collapse, gravity sliding, or the juxtaposition of several independent volcanic centers. The area is the source of the voluminous, mostly submarine Roseau Tuff, a thick sequence of pyroclastic flows erupted between about 40,000 and 25,000 years ago. It is considered to have originated from calderas at Morne Trois Piton and Wotten Waven, the latter an elliptical NE-SW-trending caldera containing Microtin at its NE end. Explosive eruptions at the Trois Piton-Microtin complex producing pyroclastic flows continued into the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The youngest dated eruption took place about 800 CE, but other smaller eruptions may have occurred since."

An arcuate caldera that formed about 39,000 years ago as a result of a major explosive eruption and flank collapse is open to Soufrière Bay on the west. This depression cuts the SW side of Morne Plat Pays stratovolcano and extends to the southern tip of Dominica. At least a dozen small post-caldera lava domes were emplaced within and outside this depression, including one submarine dome south of Scotts Head. The latest dated eruptions occurred from the Morne Patates lava dome about 1270 CE, although younger deposits have not yet been dated. The Morne Plat Pays complex is the site of extensive fumarolic activity, and at least ten swarms of small-magnitude earthquakes, none associated with eruptive activity, have occurred since 1765 at Morne Patates."
"Pelee","-61.165,14.809","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/106068.jpg","","Renowned Montagne Pelée, forming the northern end of the island of Martinique, is the most active volcano of the Lesser Antilles arc. Three major edifice failures since the late Pleistocene, the last about 9000 years ago, have left large horseshoe-shaped calderas breached to the SW inside which the modern volcano has been constructed. More than 20 major eruptions have occurred here during the past 5000 years. Extensive pyroclastic-flow deposits, incised by steep-walled ravines, mantle the slopes of the volcano. The l'Etang Sec summit crater is filled by two lava domes emplaced during the 1902 and 1929 eruptions. Historical eruptions date back to the 18th century; only two modest phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions took place prior to 1902. The catastrophic 1902 eruption, which destroyed the city of St. Pierre, the 'Pearl of the Lesser Antilles,' became the type-example of pelean eruptions and marked the onset of modern volcanological studies of the behavior of pyroclastic flows."
"Qualibou","-61.050,13.830","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/055027.jpg","","The Qualibou caldera on the SW side of St. Lucia provides the setting for the Pitons, two steep-sided pre-caldera lava domes that form one of the scenic highlights of the West Indies. The 3.5 x 5-km-wide caldera formed about 32-39,000 years ago in conjunction with the eruption of the Choiseul Tuff. A larger depression has been interpreted to have formed by edifice collapse, and bathymetry has identified large submarine debris-avalanche deposits off the west coast of the island. This depression and associated volcanic vents and geothermal areas is also known as the Soufrière volcanic centre. Numerous resurgent post-caldera lava domes fill the caldera floor. The latest dated magmatic eruptions took place about 20,000 years ago, but younger undated lava domes and explosion craters are present. The only known Holocene eruptive activity was a minor phreatic eruption in the Sulfur Springs geothermal area in 1766 CE that ejected a thin ash layer over a wide area. A volcanic earthquake swarm centered 6 km ESE of the caldera occurred in 1990."

The 1.6-km wide summit crater, whose NE rim is cut by a crater formed in 1812, lies on the SW margin of the 2.2-km-wide Somma crater, which is breached widely to the SW as a result of slope failure. Frequent explosive eruptions since about 4300 years ago produced pyroclastic deposits of the Yellow Tephra Formation, which blanket much of the island. The first historical eruption of the volcano took place during 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that coincided with the catastrophic Mont Pelée eruption on Martinique. A lava dome was emplaced in the summit crater in 1971 during a strictly effusive eruption, forming an island in a lake that filled the crater prior to an eruption in 1979. The lake was then largely ejected during a series of explosive eruptions, and the dome was replaced with another."

Recent bathymetric surveys have shown evidence for a major arcuate collapse structure that was the source of a submarine debris avalanche that traveled more than 15 km to the west. Bathymetry also revealed another submarine cone to the SE, Kick 'em Jack, and submarine lava domes to its south. These and subaerial tuff rings and lava flows at Ile de Caille and other nearby islands may represent a single large volcanic complex. Numerous historical eruptions, mostly documented by acoustic signals, have occurred at Kick 'em Jenny since 1939, when an eruption cloud rose 275 m above the sea surface. Prior to the 1939 eruption, which was witnessed by a large number of people in northern Grenada, there had been no written mention of Kick 'em Jenny. Eruptions have involved both explosive activity and the quiet extrusion of lava flows and lava domes in the summit crater; deep rumbling noises have sometimes been heard onshore. Historical eruptions have modified the morphology of the summit crater."

Pyroclastic-flow deposits extend to the NW from the extensively weathered volcano. The most recent activity on Grenada originated from a group of young maars, tuff rings, and scoria cones that extend SSW-NNE across the length of the 30-km-long island. Kick 'em Jenny, the historically active submarine volcano 8 km north of Grenada, is listed separately in this compilation along with adjacent submarine and subaerial cones that may represent a single volcanic complex. No eruptions of St. Catherine are known in historical time, although the most recent eruption along a NE-SW-trending fault cutting across the island produced a scoria cone near Radix village that could be less than 1000 years old. Hot springs and fumaroles are present at several locations on Mount St. Catherine."

The roughly 7 x 11 km central caldera of Hofsjökull volcano lies beneath the western part of the massive Hofsjökull icecap. A small Holocene shield volcano is located at the SW margin of the icecap. Flank fissures north and east of the icecap have produced basaltic lava flows during the Holocene. Kerlingarfjöll, a glacially dissected, largely Pleistocene rhyolitic central volcano located SW of the Hofsjökull icecap, is considered part of the Hofsjökull volcanic system. Steep-sided Pleistocene rhyolitic lava domes and numerous hot springs occupy two calderas at the center of the 5 x 7 km wide complex.

A large 10 x 14 km subglacial caldera with a long axis in a NW-SE direction is up to 750 m deep. Its high point reaches 1380 m, and three major outlet glaciers have breached its rim. Although most historical eruptions have taken place from fissures inside the caldera, the Eldgjá fissure system, which extends about 60 km to the NE from the current ice margin towards Grímsvötn volcano, has been the source of major Holocene eruptions. An eruption from the Eldgjá fissure system about 934 CE produced a voluminous lava flow of about 18 cu km, one of the world's largest known Holocene lava flows. Katla has been the source of frequent subglacial basaltic explosive eruptions that have been among the largest tephra-producers in Iceland during historical time and has also produced numerous dacitic explosive eruptions during the Holocene."

The dominantly rhyolitic complex rises about 500 m above surrounding basaltic plains and is elongated in a WNW-ESE direction. Most rhyolitic lava flows were erupted subglacially, forming silicic hyaloclastites that form ridge and dome-shaped breccias. During postglacial times only a narrow fissure zone at the western end has been active, producing mostly silicic lava flows, lava domes, and tephras. The most recent silicic eruption produced the Hrafntinnuhraun lava flow about 900 CE. The fissure system is along trend with and was active at the same time as the basaltic Veidivötn fissure system of Bárdarbunga central volcano in 1477 CE.

Hekla occupies a rift-transform junction, and has produced basaltic andesites, in contrast to the tholeiitic basalts typical of Icelandic rift zone volcanoes. Vatnafjöll, a 40-km-long, 9-km-wide group of basaltic fissures and crater rows immediately SE of Hekla forms a part of the Hekla-Vatnafjöll volcanic system. A 5.5-km-long fissure, Heklugjá, cuts across the 1491-m-high Hekla volcano and is often active along its full length during major eruptions. Repeated eruptions along this rift, which is oblique to most rifting structures in the eastern volcanic zone, are responsible for Hekla's elongated ENE-WSW profile. Frequent large silicic explosive eruptions during historical time have deposited tephra throughout Iceland, providing valuable time markers used to date eruptions from other Icelandic volcanoes. Hekla tephras are generally rich in fluorine and are consequently very hazardous to grazing animals. Extensive lava flows from historical eruptions, which date back to 1104 CE, cover much of the volcano's flanks."

The geothermal area in the caldera causes frequent jökulhlaups (glacier outburst floods) when melting raises the water level high enough to lift its ice dam. Long NE-SW-trending fissure systems extend from the central volcano. The most prominent of these is the noted Laki (Skaftar) fissure, which extends to the SW and produced the world's largest known historical lava flow during an eruption in 1783.

A nearly circular ring of six Holocene pyroclastic cones occupies the caldera floor. These have been the source of a dozen trachytic pumice-fall deposits erupted during the past 5000 years. Sete Cidades is one of the most active Azorean volcanoes. Historical eruptions date back to the 15th century and have occurred from within the caldera and from submarine vents off the west coast."
"Agua de Pau","-25.470,37.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/061010.jpg","","Agua de Pau stratovolcano in central Sao Miguel Island contains an outer 4 x 7 km caldera formed about 30,000 to 45,000 years ago and an inner 2.5 x 3 km caldera that was created about 15,000 years ago. The younger caldera is partially filled by the Lagoa do Fogo caldera lake. Several post-caldera lava domes were emplaced on the northern and western flanks of the volcano, but activity in the caldera did not resume until about 5000 years ago. The 3-cu-km Fogo-A plinian pumice-fall deposit, the product of the largest-known Holocene eruption in the Azores, was emplaced at this time. Numerous flank cinder cones mark radial and concentric fissures, some of which have been active during historical time. The latest trachytic explosive eruption took place during 1563. Prominent hot springs are located on the NW flank."
"Furnas","-25.320,37.770","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/062027.jpg","","Furnas volcano lies at the eastern end of Sao Miguel Island, immediately west of the older Nordeste shield volcano and its Povoaçao caldera. Furnas contains at least two calderas, a younger one that is 6-km wide and a larger older one that is less topographically distinct. The eastern wall of the 500-m-deep caldera of Furnas overlaps the western wall of the Povoaçao caldera of Nordeste volcano. Volcanic activity at Furnas dates back about 100,000 years. At least 11 trachytic pumice layers, all erupted during the past 5000 years, post-date the caldera. The most prominent post-caldera feature is the Pico do Gaspar lava dome, east of the Lagoa das Furnas caldera lake. A zone of late-Pleistocene to Holocene basaltic-to-trachytic cinder cones and lava domes is located between Furnas and Agua de Pau volcanoes. Two historical eruptions have occurred at Furnas, one sometime between 1439 and 1443 and the other in 1630. The latter was one of the largest Holocene explosive eruptions in the Azores and caused significant damage and fatalities."
"Monaco Bank","-25.880,37.600","Monaco Bank is a submarine volcano constructed along a NW-SE-trending fissure 20-km south of the western tip of Sao Miguel Island. The linear volcano is located along regional tectonic trends connecting Sete Cidades volcano with Santa María Island, SE of Monaco Bank.

"Madeira","-16.970,32.730","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/117035.jpg","","Madeira Island is the emergent top of a massive shield volcano that rises about 6 km from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and forms the largest island of the Madeira Archipelago, about 90 km in length. Construction of the volcano along E-W-trending rift zones from the Miocene to about 700,000 years ago was followed by a period of extensive erosion and possible edifice collapse. Two steep-walled amphitheaters open to south in the central part of the island. Late-stage eruptions are scattered throughout the island and lasted until the Holocene, producing scoria cones and intracanyon lava flows mantling rocks of the older eroded edifice. The youngest activity at Madeira lies in the west-central part of the island, and consists of cinder cones in the upper Sao Vicente valley, a series of intracanyon flows, and a tephra layer on top of the Paul da Serra plateau dated at about 6500 years ago."

The older 2426-m-high northern one is cut by the massive steep-walled Caldera Taburiente, one of several massive collapse scarps produced by edifice failure to the SW. The younger 1949-m-high Cumbre Vieja, the southern volcano, is one of the most active in the Canaries. The elongated volcano dates back to about 125,000 years ago and is oriented N-S. Eruptions during the past 7000 years have originated from the abundant cinder cones and craters along the axis of Cumbre Vieja, producing fissure-fed lava flows that descend steeply to the sea. Historical eruptions at La Palma, recorded since the 15th century, have produced mild explosive activity and lava flows that damaged populated areas. The southern tip of the island is mantled by a broad lava field produced during the 1677-1678 eruption. Lava flows also reached the sea in 1585, 1646, 1712, 1949, and 1971."

The NE-trending Cordillera Dorsal volcanic massif joins the Las Cañadas volcano on the SW side of Tenerife with older volcanoes, creating the largest volcanic complex of the Canary Islands. Controversy surrounds the formation of the dramatic 10 x 17 km Las Cañadas caldera, which is partially filled by 3715-m-high Teide stratovolcano, the highest peak in the Atlantic Ocean. The origin of the caldera has been variably considered to be due to collapse following multiple major explosive eruptions or as a result of a massive landslide (in a manner similar to the earlier formation of the massive La Orotava and Guimar valleys), or a combination of the two processes. The most recent stage of activity beginning in the late Pleistocene included the construction of the Pico Viejo and Teide edifices. Tenerife was perhaps observed in eruption by Christopher Columbus, and several flank vents on the Canary Island's most active volcano have been active during historical time."

Three major volcanic structures form the circular 60-km-wide island, which has been modified by caldera collapse, gravitational edifice failure, and extensive erosion. Middle Quaternary scoria cones and lava flows are found in the northern and eastern parts of the massive shield volcano, which is cut by a major NW-SE-trending rift zone that extends across the island and fed flows primarily to the NE. Very young basaltic cones and lava flows of Holocene age are situated within a NW-trending zone from Berrazales to Bandama and at Las Isletas, a peninsula on the NE coast. One cinder cone was radiocarbon dated at about 3000 years before present, and other cones and flows may be less than 1000 years old."

The youngest lavas are found at the northern and central portions of the arid, sparsely vegetated island. Malpais de la Arena, the Northern Malpais, and the Lobos Island areas at the northern tip of Fuerteventura are the sites of broad fields of youthful cinder cones and lava flows. The Malpais Chico, Malpais Grande, and Malpais de Jacomar areas on the south-central part of the island represent smaller zones of youthful volcanism, as do the volcanoes of Pajara, which were constructed on the older plutonic massif west of the axis of the island. No historical eruptions have occurred on Fuerteventura. although the very youthful appearance of lava flow surfaces in the central part of the island suggests a late-Holocene or prehistoric age."
"Lanzarote","-13.630,29.030","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/087038.jpg","","The 60-km-long island of Lanzarote at the NE end of the Canary Islands contains the largest concentration of youthful volcanism in the Canaries. Pleistocene-and-Holocene cinder cones and lava flows erupted along NE-SW-trending fissures are found throughout the low-altitude arid island and on smaller islands to the north. The largest historical eruption of the Canary Islands took place during 1730-36, when long-term eruptions from a NE-SW-trending fissure formed the Montañas del Fuego and produced voluminous lava flows that covered about 200 sq km. The lava flows reached the western coast along a broad, 20-km-wide front. The villages of Maretas and Santa Catalina were destroyed, along with the most fertile valleys and estates of the arid island. An eruption during 1824 produced a much smaller lava flow that reached the SW coast."
"Fogo","-24.350,14.950","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/095016.jpg","","The island of Fogo consists of a single massive stratovolcano that is the most prominent of the Cape Verde Islands. The roughly circular 25-km-wide island is truncated by a large 9-km-wide caldera that is breached to the east and has a headwall 1 km high. The caldera is located asymmetrically NE of the center of the island and was formed as a result of massive lateral collapse of the ancestral Monte Armarelo edifice. A very youthful steep-sided central cone, Pico, rises more than 1 km above the caldera floor to about 100 m above the caldera rim, forming the 2829 m high point of the island. Pico, which is capped by a 500-m-wide, 150-m-deep summit crater, was apparently in almost continuous activity from the time of Portuguese settlement in 1500 CE until around 1760. Later historical lava flows, some from vents on the caldera floor, reached the eastern coast below the breached caldera."

The 10-km-wide island contains 15 morphologically youthful craters located along two or three lineaments intersecting along the crest of the island. The youthfulness of the craters and numerous minor earthquakes in recent years indicate that a significant volcanic hazard still exists (Wolff and Turbeville, 1985). Most of the younger eruptions originated from the interaction of phonolitic magmas with a large groundwater reservoir contained within an older volcanic series characterized by thick welded ignimbrites and block-and-ash flow deposits. Carbonatitic lavas are also found on Brava."
"Romanche Fracture Zone","-19.596,-0.433","Several reports of submarine disturbances of possible volcanic origin near the equator were noted by Neumann van Padang et al. (1967) in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (CAVW). Ship captains have reported numerous submarine eruptions during the 18th and 19th centuries over a broad area in this part of the Atlantic, including accounts of observations of seaquakes, turbulent water, columns of smoke, floating pumice, submarine banks, or small ephemeral islands. These accounts were tentatively collectively assigned by the CAVW to a seamount along the Romanche Fracture Zone, although their locations span a broad area up to 400 km W of the assigned location. Floating 'volcanic ash' was collected in 1836 from a site near the Mid-Atlantic Rift, well E of the seamount. The validity of these reports is not clear, although three of these events were considered by the CAVW to possibly represent submarine eruptions."

Ascensión is the broad emergent summit of a massive stratovolcano that rises 3000 m above the sea floor. The isolated island, 1130 km from the nearest land, is dotted with more than 100 youthful parasitic cones and lava domes, many aligned along two fissures. Basaltic rocks dominate on the 858-m-high island, although trachytic lava domes are also present, mostly on the eastern side. Although no eruptive activity has occurred since its discovery during the 16th century, many volcanic features on Ascensión have a very youthful appearance. Two of the youngest lava flows were erupted from flank vents and reached the sea on the northern and southern coasts."

The island lies more than halfway between Brazil and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the eastern end of the submarine Vitória-Trindade Ridge. Trindade is a dissected volcanic island with numerous phonolitic lava domes and steep-sided volcanic plugs. The youngest volcanism, at Vulcao de Paredao on the SE tip of the island, constructed a pyroclastic cone with lava flows that are no older than Holocene (Almeida, 1961). Remnants of the crater of the 200-m-high cinder cone are still preserved. Lava flows traveled from the cone to the north, where they form an irregular shoreline and offshore islands. Smaller volcanic centers of the latest volcanic stage are found in the Morro Vermelho area in the south-central part of the island."

The signals, similar to those produced by a 2001 submarine eruption of Kick 'em Jenny volcano in the West Indies, reached a peak on 19-20 December 2001."
"Nightingale Island","-12.480,-37.420","Nightingale Island and the adjacent smaller Middle (or Alex) and Stoltenhoff Islands and associated small islets are the southernmost of the Tristan da Cunha island group. The heavily eroded island consists of early and late stage ash and agglomerate units with intervening massive trachytic intrusions and lava flows. Volcanic rocks were K-Ar dated at between 0.4 and 0.15 million years, and a radiocarbon date of about 39,000 yrs BP was obtained from an ash layer overlain by a lava flow. An earthquake swarm lasting 6 hours beginning on 29 July 2004 was followed by observation of large blocks of floating phonolitic pumice that washed up on Tristan da Cunha. The event was considered to have originated from an eruption associated with an earthquake swarm 37-53 km SSE of Tristan da Cunha on the submarine SE flank of Nightingale Island."

The 2060-m-high shield volcano is bounded on most sides by high cliffs. Lava flows dominate both the low-angle base and the steep upper flanks, although pyroclastic cones ringing the central cone are scattered around the lower flanks. Eruptions have occurred from the 300-m-wide summit crater, Queen Mary's Peak, which contains a small lake, and from numerous flank vents, some of which occurred from radial fissures. Radial dike swarms are prominently exposed on all sides of the island. Numerous strombolian cinder cones occur on the flanks of the volcano along both concentric ring structures and NNW- and ENE-trending radial fissures. The only historical eruption on Tristan da Cunha occurred during 1961 from a northshore vent and forced the evacuation of the island's only settlement."

The Pleiades are located in the Melbourne volcanic province of Antarctica's northern Victoria Land near the western coast of the Ross Sea. Three nested cones containing distinct craters cap Mount Pleiones. A Potassium-Argon age of 3000 years was obtained from the Taygete cone NNE of Mount Pleiones, and the Pleiades appear to be among the youngest volcanic centers in Antarctica. Other dates of 12-40,000 years support a youthful age despite the large analytical uncertainties."

Subaerial basaltic lava flows dominate, but subglacial or subaqueous tuffs and lava flows are also present. A tephra layer from an eruption of a subglacial volcano in the Hudson Mountains was dated from ice thickness at about 200 BCE.

The 3794-m-high Erebus is the largest of three major volcanoes forming the crudely triangular Ross Island. The summit of the dominantly phonolitic volcano has been modified by one or two generations of caldera formation. A summit plateau at about 3200 m elevation marks the rim of the youngest caldera, which formed during the late-Pleistocene and within which the modern cone was constructed. An elliptical 500 x 600 m wide, 110-m-deep crater truncates the summit and contains an active lava lake within a 250-m-wide, 100-m-deep inner crater. The glacier-covered volcano was erupting when first sighted by Captain James Ross in 1841. Continuous lava-lake activity with minor explosions, punctuated by occasional larger strombolian explosions that eject bombs onto the crater rim, has been documented since 1972, but has probably been occurring for much of the volcano's recent history."
"Penguin Island","-57.930,-62.100","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/062005.jpg","","The small 1.4 x 1.7 km Penguin Island is located off the SE coast of King George Island in Antarctica's Shetland Islands, west of the axis of the Bransfield Rift. The most prominent feature on Penguin Island is Deacon Peak, a basaltic scoria cone with a 350-m-wide well-preserved summit crater that forms the 180-m-high summit on the SW side of the island. A small plug of basaltic lava occupies the 75-m-deep crater. Petrel Crater, a 300-m-wide maar, is located near the east coast. The formation of Deacon Peak scoria cone was dated by lichenometry at about 300 years ago, and the younger Petrel Crater maar was dated at about 100 years (Birkenmajer 1979). Some of the historical reports of fumarolic activity on nearby Bridgeman Island are attributed to the more youthful Penguin Island."
"Deception Island","-60.652,-63.001","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/062001.jpg","","Ring-shaped Deception Island, one of Antarctica's most well known volcanoes, contains a 7-km-wide caldera flooded by the sea. Deception Island is located at the SW end of the Shetland Islands, NE of Graham Land Peninsula, and was constructed along the axis of the Bransfield Rift spreading center. A narrow passageway named Neptunes Bellows provides entrance to a natural harbor that was utilized as an Antarctic whaling station. Numerous vents located along ring fractures circling the low, 14-km-wide island have been active during historical time. Maars line the shores of 190-m-deep Port Foster, the caldera bay. Among the largest of these maars is 1-km-wide Whalers Bay, at the entrance to the harbor. Eruptions from Deception Island during the past 8700 years have been dated from ash layers in lake sediments on the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands."
"Paulet","-55.780,-63.579","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/121053.jpg","","Paulet is a small 2.5 x 3.5 km island located east of the tip of Graham Land Peninsula. The pear-shaped 353-m-high island is composed of lava flows capped by a well-preserved cinder cone with a small summit crater. The youthful morphology of the volcano was thought to indicate activity during the last 1000 years (LeMasurier and Thomson 1990). Residual heat keeps the island largely ice free throughout the year."
"Bridgeman Island","-56.717,-62.061","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/061088.jpg","","Bridgeman Island is a small 0.9 x 0.6 km remnant of a much larger volcanic edifice that is now largely submerged. It was constructed along the axis of the Bransfield Rift spreading center between the Shetland and Wedell tectonic plates. Bridgeman is located east of King George Island at the NE end of the Shetland Islands, north of the tip of Graham Land Peninsula. The 240-m-high island has a gently sloping top consisting of truncated lava flows. Steep cliffs surrounding the island expose older lavas and bedded pyroclastic rocks. The extensively eroded volcano does not display youthful volcanic features, although it has been characterized as a now inactive late Pleistocene-Holocene stratovolcano. Several reports of 19th-century fumarolic activity (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) may instead refer to the much younger Penguin Island (González-Ferrán, 1972)."
"Seal Nunataks Group","-60.050,-65.030","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/062013.jpg","","The Seal Nunataks are a group of 16 Pleistocene-to-Recent nunataks emerging from the Larsen Ice Shelf east of Graham Land Peninsula. Most of the larger nunataks are considered to represent separate volcanic vents erupted in a shallow-water environment. Fumarolic activity was reported from Murdoch and Dallman cones in 1982, and fresh-looking pyroclastics and a lava flow at Dallman (not observed in 1979) were seen on the ice surface three years later (González-Ferrán 1983). Fumarolic activity was observed at Christensen in 1893, and Lindenberg was observed in eruption in 1893. Baker (1968) saw cinders on the ice surface, suggesting a 20th-century eruption, and similar observations were reported in 1985 and 2010, but these events may have been due to aeolian tephra redistribution. A 1988 British expedition noted that tephra away from nunataks was found only in ice-cored moraines, suggesting a glacial rather than pyroclastic origin. They noted no fumarolic activity, although water vapor resulting from radiant heating of ice-cored moraines was observed."
"Thule Islands","-27.186,-59.458","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109093.jpg","","The Thule Islands, at the southern end of the South Sandwich island arc bordering the Scotia Sea, consist of three stratovolcanoes constructed along an E-W-trending line. An ice-filled 1.5-2 km wide caldera truncates the summit of andesitic-dacitic Thule, the westernmost island, and a 4.3 x 4.8 km submarine caldera forms Douglas Strait between Thule and basaltic-to-dacitic Cook Island. Another possible submarine caldera lies east of Cook Island and south of basaltic-andesite Bellingshausen, the easternmost island. The age of Cook Island is uncertain, but steam was observed at the summit crater of Thule Island in 1962, and ash was seen on the surface of the ice there and on Bellingshausen Island, indicating possible 20th-century eruptions (Baker, 1968). Bellingshausen Island has a youthful, relatively ice-free profile and an extensive well-preserved lava field on its southern flank. A small explosion crater formed on the southern flank of Bellinghausen Island sometime between 1964 and 1986."
"Montagu Island","-26.330,-58.420","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/119088.jpg","","The largest of the South Sandwich Islands, Montagu consists of a massive shield volcano cut by a 6-km-wide ice-filled summit caldera. The summit of the 10 x 12 km wide island rises about 3000 m from the sea floor between Bristol and Saunders Islands. Around 90% of the island is ice-covered; glaciers extending to the sea typically form vertical ice cliffs. The name Mount Belinda has been applied both to the high point at the southern end of the summit caldera and to the young central cone. Mount Oceanite, an isolated 900-m-high peak with a 270-m-wide summit crater, lies at the SE tip of the island and was the source of lava flows exposed at Mathias Point and Allen Point. There was no record of Holocene or historical eruptive activity until MODIS satellite data, beginning in late 2001, revealed thermal anomalies consistent with lava lake activity that has been persistent since then. Apparent plumes and single anomalous pixels were observed intermittently on AVHRR images during the period March 1995 to February 1998, possibly indicating earlier unconfirmed and more sporadic volcanic activity."
"Bristol Island","-26.587,-59.063","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109098.jpg","","The 9 x 10 km Bristol Island near the southern end of the South Sandwich arc lies across Fortser's Passage from the Southern Thule Islands and forms one of the largest islands of the chain. Largely glacier-covered, it contains a horseshoe-shaped ridge at the interior extending northward from the highest peak, 1100-m-high Mount Darnley. A steep-sided flank cone or lava dome, Havfruen Peak, is located on the east side, and a young crater and fissure are on the west flank. Three large sea stacks lying off Turmoil Point at the western tip of the island may be remnants of an older now-eroded volcanic center. Both summit and flank vents have been active during historical time. The latest eruption, during 1956, originated from the west-flank crater, and deposited cinder over the icecap. The extensive icecap and the difficulty of landing make it the least explored of the South Sandwich Islands."
"Michael","-26.460,-57.787","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/109094.jpg","","The young constructional Mount Michael stratovolcano dominates glacier-covered Saunders Island. The symmetrical 990-m-high edifice has a 700-m-wide summit crater and a remnant of a somma rim to the SE. Tephra layers visible in ice cliffs surrounding the island are evidence of recent eruptions. Ash clouds were reported from the summit crater in 1819, and an effusive eruption was inferred to have occurred from a north-flank fissure around the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. A low ice-free lava platform, Blackstone Plain, is located on the north coast, surrounding a group of former sea stacks. A cluster of parasitic cones on the SE flank, the Ashen Hills, appear to have been modified since 1820 (LeMasurier and Thomson 1990). Vapor emission is frequently reported from the summit crater. Recent AVHRR and MODIS satellite imagery has revealed evidence for lava lake activity in the summit crater."
"Candlemas Island","-26.670,-57.080","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110092.jpg","","The southern end of Candlemas Island consists of an eroded, glacier-covered basaltic stratovolcano cut by steep cliffs on the east. Lava flows along the cliff dip to the west, suggesting that the original summit vent was beyond the eastern shoreline. The northern end of the irregularly shaped, 6-km-long island consists of an andesitic-to-dacitic complex of scoria cones with radiating lava flows. These initially formed a separate island but now consist of a low attached platform that is estimated to be no more than a few hundred years old (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990). Dark brown clouds mixed with white steam were reported in 1823 and 1911, but it has not been demonstrated which, if any, of the young north flank lava flows formed since the island was discovered in 1775. Geysers and hot pools have been observed on several occasions during the 20th century. Vindication Island, of possible Holocene age, is located 4.5 km west of Candlemas Island."
"Hodson","-27.176,-56.712","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110093.jpg","","The largely ice-covered, 6 x 8 km Visokoi Island consists of a single stratovolcano, Mount Hodson, whose rounded 1005-m-high summit lies west of the center of the island. Numerous basaltic scoria cones were constructed on the lower flanks of the oval-shaped island, which is part of the Traverse Islands in the northern part of the South Sandwich Island chain. The youthful morphology suggests that volcanic activity has continued until virtually the present time (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990). Possible eruptive activity was reported during 1830 and 1930, and the summit is usually obscured by 'smoke' or steam."
"Leskov Island","-28.140,-56.656","The small crescent-shaped Leskov Island lies about 50 km west of the main axis of the South Sandwich Islands, but appears to be comparable in age to volcanoes along the main arc. Leskov Island, only 900 m long and 400 m wide, is bounded by steep cliffs and is the eroded remnant of a small andesitic stratovolcano. Its arcuate, NE-facing escarpment is concave toward Crater Bay, the site of the main eruptive center. The age of Leskov Island is not known. A single Potassium-Argon determination gave an age of 0.5 million years, but fumarolic activity was recorded along the summit ridge in 1911 and 1964 (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990)."
"Zavodovski","-27.570,-56.300","http://www.volcano.si.edu//Photos/small/110091.jpg","","The 5-km-wide Zavodovski Island, the northernmost of the South Sandwich Islands, consists of a single 551-m-high basaltic stratovolcano with two parasitic cones on the east side. Mount Curry, the island's summit, lies west of the center of the island, which is more eroded on that side. Two fissures extend NE from the summit towards the east-flank craters, and a lava platform is located along the eastern coast. Zavodovski is the most frequently visited of the South Sandwich Islands. It was erupting when first seen in 1819 by the explorer Bellingshausen, and the volcano has been reported to be smoking during subsequent visits."
"Protector Shoal","-28.246,-56.014","Protector Shoal seamount, located 50 km NW of Zavodovski Island, forms the northernmost volcano of the arcuate South Sandwich Islands. The broad, gently sloping cone rises from a depth of 1200 m to within 27 m of the sea surface. The submarine volcano has a gentle gradient to the north, but is steeper on the south side. At least two satellitic cones are present. Large amounts of rhyolitic pumice, first detected by the Royal Navy Ice Patrol Vessel H.M.S. Protector, were ejected during its only recorded eruption in 1962 and formed an extensive pumice raft which drifted as far as New Zealand."
"Rittmann, Mount","165.500,-73.450","Mount Rittmann, a roughly 8 x 5 km caldera under the Aviator Glacier in the Melbourne Volcanic Province, has been dated at between about 4 and 0.07 million years ago (Martin et al., 2010). Active fumaroles, heated ground, and ice and snow hummocks occur near the caldera rim."
"Melville","-57.670,-62.020","Melville Peak is an eroded stratovolcano on NE King George Island with a summit crater. No radiocarbon dates are available, but an ash layer found 30 km away in a NE Bransfield Strait marine sediment core with compositional similarity to Melville Peak suggests possible Holocene activity within the past few thousand years."
"James Ross Island","-57.750,-64.150","James Ross Island is a massive, dominantly Miocene to Pliocene, shield volcano along the Larsen Rift near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula with more youthful flank tuff cones and other pyroclastic centers. The glacier-covered Mount Haddington shield volcano forms the 1630 m high point of the island. Effusive eruptions fed large lava deltas with basal hyalocalstite breccias overlain by subaerial lava flows. Well-preserved tuff cones and pyroclastic cones on the eastern flank below the summit icecap were considered to be only a few thousand years old (Smellie et al., 2008)."
